INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (1,1,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>After much talk about the ideas for improving the <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Reports</a>, I\'m finally please to announce the completion of the work so far. There have been 3 significant changes to the site behind the scenes, all of which will hopefully improve the way everyone interacts with the site.</p>\r\n<p>Phase Two was to finish off a number changes to enable a dynamic site. As it\'s turned out a full dynamic site hasn\'t been possible, as some of the pages still take several minutes to retrieve all the records from the database and render the pages. The \'ADAMK test\' took over 30 minutes! As such a redesign of the caching was implemented that now means the pages are updated in the background. It means that the most frequently visited pages are more likely to be up to date now.</p>\r\n<p>Phase Three was to implement a flat HTML site, that was similar to the old site, before the Javascript was included, but also benefits from all the fixes that have been implemented into the current site. As a result of the caching changes in Phase Two, this was actually extremely easy to implement, as it only meant adding templates.</p>\r\n<p>With all that done, I was virtually ready to implement the sites on the live server. However, following a post by Adam Kennedy about the state of some of the Perl websites, I decided to hold back and concentrate on Phase Four. This last phase wasn\'t just planned for the reports sites, but aimed at covering all the CPAN Testers websites I\'m responsible for. When I first created the Statistics website, I was more interested in making the the data and information available, and always figured I\'d get around to designing a proper layout at some point. With me taking a month out during April, the time was ripe to completely redesign all the sites. So taking an inital design from the OSWD site, I amended it appropriately for my uses, and I have now converted all the CPAN Testers sites I look after across to the new design.</p>\r\n<p>Hopefully the new design will meet with everyone\'s approval (Leon, fear not there is still an orange colour scheme in there :)), and the changes to the functionality improve the way people are able to use and access the site. For the time being the old path mappings should remain working, but I would advise moving to the new path structure when the sites go live.</p>\r\n<p>So when are you going to get to see all these changes? Well very very soon. I\'m currently setting up the new designs on the server and once everything is in place I\'ll be doing a symlink switch. Please be patient .. just a little while longer ;)</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (2,2,1,2,0,NULL,'<h2>Who, What, Why?</h2>\r\n<p>CPAN Testers is a volunteer effort to test distributions as they are uploaded to CPAN, the Perl code repository. There are currently over 100 testers, who are able to test across several different versions of Perl and on many different platforms.</p>\r\n<p>There are two aims behind the CPAN Testers projects, firstly to give feedback to authors, and secondly to give users the opportunity to check whether a particular distribution will install and run on their system.</p>\r\n<p>Authors often are limited to the number of Perl/platform combinations, so CPAN Testers provide a unique opportunity to get feedback on issues which they might not receive from users trying to use their distribution.</p>\r\n<p>Users are also able to benefit from CPAN Testers, as the reports can highlight when a distribution might be problematic. Together with the other resources, such as the <a href=\"http://pass.cpantesters.org\">PASS Matrix</a>, <a href=\"http://deps.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Dependencies</a> and the <a href=\"http://matrix.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Matrix</a>, users can make an informed choice as to which distributions might be best for them.</p>\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>The CPAN testers was conceived back in May 1998 by Graham Barr and Chris Nandor as a way to provide multi-platform testing for modules. Today there are over 3 million tester reports and more than 100 testers each month giving valuable feedback for users and authors alike.</p>\r\n<p>For several years testers created test reports by hand, until CPANPLUS included a simple test smoker script. This script was dropped when CPANPLUS-0.50 was redesigned, such that the new API was no longer compatible. Robert Rothenberg and Barbie wrote CPAN-YACSmoke, which lasted for several years. In the meantime those using CPAN.pm as their installer felt there should be a counterpart for them. As such David Golden wrote <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Reporter\">CPAN-Reporter</a>. Due to lack of time to work on the core software, <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-YACSmoke\">CPAN-YACSmoke</a> started to stagnate, to the point Chris Williams wrote <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPANPLUS-YACSmoke\">CPANPLUS-YACSmoke</a> as a replacement.</p>\r\n<p>The current eco-system is driven by SMTP/NNTP, which is creaking under the weight of the reports. The future is looking to move CT2.0 to a HTTP system based on the new Metabase system being developed by Ricardo Signes and David Golden.</p>\r\n<h2>The New Team<br /></h2>\r\n<p>The people promoting CPAN Testers has changed over the years, as interest in the project fluctuates. However, right now we have a very dedicated team working behind the scenes to ensure that we are continually refining and improving the process of testing and reporting, and providing the authors with the right feedback to help improve their code.</p>\r\n<p>Specific mentions should go to the following people, who although act as primary contacts for specific parts of the toolchain mentioned, all have helped to maintain CPAN Testers eco-system.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Dave Golden - CPAN-Reporter / Metabase</li>\r\n<li>Chris \'BinGOs\' Williams - CPANPLUS-Reporter</li>\r\n<li>Andreas K&ouml;nig - CPAN.pm</li>\r\n<li>Jos Boumans - CPANPLUS</li>\r\n<li>Ricardo Signes - Metabase</li>\r\n<li>David Cantrell - CPAN Dependencies</li>\r\n<li>Slaven Rezi&#263; - CPAN Testers Matrix</li>\r\n<li>Barbie - Databases &amp; Websites</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Resources<br /></h2>\r\n<p>If you have any issues with any part of the process, please use the resouces we have available to help improve the feedback and use of CPAN Testers to you. Specifically if you are an author or a tester, please see the <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers Wiki</a>, to see if there is anything appropriate there, or join the <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/MailingLists\">\'CPAN Testers Discuss\'</a> mailing list and ask your question there.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (3,3,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>So this month has mostly featured a lot of work after the QA Hackathon, without too many announcements. While there has been a lot of changes behind the scenes, we\'ve mostly been getting on with stuff. David Golden and Ricardo Signes have been continuing with the Metabase, to the point David can now submit reports locally. There is still a bit of work needed to get the rest of the pieces all synced and working, but we are getting closer to CT2.0.</p>\r\n<p>The mailers managed to highlight a fault recently, that has now been fixed, so if you\'ve been wondering why the Summaries haven\'t been appearing, they should start filtering through again soon. <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/updates.html#April2009c\">As announced during April</a>, there are now Weekly and Monthly Summary reports available, as well as the ability to receive individual mails again. Check the appropriate pages on the <a href=\"http://prefs.cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers Preferences</a> website and update as you require.</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned in <a href=\"http://use.perl.org/~barbie/journal/38904\">my blog last week</a>, my time over the last month has featured work on the dual dynamic and static sites for the Reports. I\'m pleased to say the underlying code is now complete. It will take a little while to carefully change the live system, as there are some significant database changes required, so I want to make sure the changes don\'t have any adverse affects. In addition, prompted by <a href=\"http://use.perl.org/~Alias/journal/38842\">Adam Kennedy\'s blog post</a> about the state of many Perl websites, I took some to look at some designs and found one that looked perfect for the job. I\'ve now reskinned several of the CPAN Testers sites and just have 1 publicly visible site left to do. There is another that has been waiting in the wings for some time, but I may wait until CT2.0 is available before unleashing it. However, with all the changes going on, there is one site that will be new (sort of), although it really is just a fork one of the existing sites. Seeing as I don\'t want to spoil the surprises, you\'re just going to have to wait for a little while longer to see all the results :)</p>\r\n<p>We passed 3.5 million test reports last month, and although there were quite a number of reports posted last month, considering that last month CPAN had the most distributions submitted in a month ever (<strong>1897</strong>), it wasn\'t quite as many as I would have expected. Unfortunately the graphs on CPAN Testers Statistics have reached their Google Chart limit, so I\'ll be altering the graphs slightly for next month.</p>\r\n<p>We topped 149 testers submitting reports last month, so thank you again to everyone involved.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (4,4,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>The <a href=\"http://prefs.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Preferences site</a> has for sometime now only offered the ability to allow authors to receive the Daily Summary Report. This was a reaction to the authors who did not wish to receive the deluge of reports that they had started to receive, with the increased volume of testing and reporting done by CPAN Testers. However, there have been several authors who have asked to still receive the individual reports, while others are happier to receive less frequent reporting.</p>\r\n<p>After several test runs over the last couple of weeks, the site can now offer the following reporting options:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Daily Summary Report</li>\r\n<li>Weekly Summary Report (choose your prefered day)</li>\r\n<li>Monthly Summary Report</li>\r\n<li>Individual Reports</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The Daily Summary Report remains as is, and has received no changes. The Weekly Summary Report and Monthly Summary Report simply provide the same style of reporting as the Daily Summary report, just over a longer period. Note that you can choose which day you wish to receive the Weekly Summary Report too.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly we have the Individual Reports. Essentially this allows the author to get the reports direct from the tester again. However, it comes with several caveats. Firstly the process behind the scenes to generate the mails is initially only going to be run once a day. Once any issues that surface over the next few weeks are resolved, this will become more frequent. Secondly, the mailer process does not receive the reports directly from the tester, it is not a mail relay in the traditional sense. The latter therefore could cause problems.</p>\r\n<p>The process for Individual Reports is to read the reports from the CPAN Testers database and regenerate the original email. Except it isn\'t the original email, as it isn\'t sent from the testers original IP. This is where problems may arise. The mails are sent from the CPAN Testers server, and any receiving server that implements SPF checking, will undoubtably reject the mails. This is perhaps most likely to affect reports from testers that use GMail or Hotmail accounts. Some authors have a challenge/request email setup, which could prove troublesome unless you\'re able to whitelist the CPAN Testers server in some way. However, if you\'ve actively selected to receive Individual Reports, then I would hope that you are prepared for this. Lastly, we have the issue of dubious email addresses used by testers. While \'root@localhost\' can get through some systems, it may get rejected by a few.</p>\r\n<p>Over the next few weeks I shall attempt to watch for any issues (as above or otherwise), and will review how the mails are sent out. If specific domains or addresses prove too troublesome, then I may have to implement a blacklist to prevent some reports from being sent. If you wish to receive the Individual Reports and spot any issues client side, please let me know and I will look into it. If you have suggestions for improving the reporting process further, then please let me know too. Though always bear in mind this system currently operates for almost 4,000 authors :)</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (5,5,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Okay so there weren\'t exactly a hundred million, but Chris Williams did pass the 1 million reports submitted mark on 10th March 2009. Andreas K&ouml;nig also passed the 500,000 reports submitted mark. Together with Slaven Rezi&#263;, David Golden and Dave Cantrell, these 5 CPAN testers now account for 2/3rds of all the reports now submitted to the CPAN Testers database. It was fantastic to have 4 of the 5 guys all meet up in Birmingham recently. I did mean to get a group photo during the hackathon, but sadly forgot :( Thanks to all the testers, for helping to make the CPAN one of the most admired code repositories in the world.</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned above, we had a few stars meet up in Birmingham at the end of March for the <a href=\"http://qa-hackathon.org\">2009 QA Hackathon</a>, all of whom made the event extremely worthwhile. The event featured 3 days of brainstorming, coding and testing. It did also feature some eating, drinking and a little bit of sleeping along the way too. The full results and thoughts of the hackathon will no doubt appear on blogs and in write-ups in the coming weeks, but I for one am really please to have been a part of it. CPAN Testers was just one of the featured projects, which saw several ideas come together. CT2.0 is firmly within our sights and we\'ll be looking to unleash it to testers very soon.</p>\r\n<p>With the hackathon over, and the fact that we\'ve now had two very successful QA Hackathons, it would be nice to continue the event next year. There is a possibility that another European location might be able to host the event next year, but there is no reason why there can\'t be a US one too. I\'m sure there are several US developers that would love to take part, but just can\'t afford the airfare to Europe. As there isn\'t a formal committee to decide a location, it\'s pretty much up to a local group to decide they would like to host the event. Perhaps you work for a company willing to provide a venue and wifi, or have funding to find somewhere equally suitable. Either way attendees from past hackathons would be delighted to hear from you. If you do want to host a QA Hackathon, please get in touch with <a href=\"http://perl.jonallen.info/\">JJ</a>, as he holds the DNS for the qa-hackathon.org domain, and would be only too pleased to point \'2010.qa-hackathon.org\' in the direction of your web server.</p>\r\n<p>During the hackathon the Metabase, that David Golden and Ricardo Signes originally devised in Oslo, got a wider audience, which meant it also got some meat and flesh on its bones, as well as giving everyone the chance to pick holes in some of the design decisions. Thankfully David and Ricardo did a very good job in the first place, so it was mostly ensuring that the edge cases were covered, and that we had an agreed method to migrate existing testers and the testing infrastructure. Looking at David and Ricardo\'s work so far, I think we have something very exciting to look forward to. There was a lot of CPAN Testers related effort over the weekend, with Chris and Jos working together on CPANPLUS related tasks, pulling in David Golden to review how to abstract the reporting code into a common distribution for CPANPLUS and CPAN.pm. Tux and Andreas looked at the structured reports, specifically looking for better ways to parse the environment to provide much more detailed reporting, even more than we have previously managed with CPAN Testers. Rich Dawe, working from David and Ricardo\'s design, wrote the transporter that will now takes the structured data and feeds it into the Metabase. The Metabase itself got a name change, as during the discussions, Ricardo realised that it could eaily be used for much more than just CPAN. It still needs work, but I think it\'s been a very productive few days, and I looking forward to getting the Metabase finally online. If only for the fact that we will finally be able to switch off the SMTP and NNTP parts of the current system.</p>\r\n<p>A couple of updates I made behind the scenes during the hackathon, included the switch to using PAUSE for the direct mirror and adding in more reporting capabilities to the Authors Notification system, that currently produces the Daily Summary Reports. With the former, Andreas\' script now updates the local <a href=\"http://mirrors.cpan.org/showmirror.cgi?name=cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers CPAN mirror</a> every 60 seconds, which means the database on the backend of the CPAN Testers infrastructure is now very up to date. Unfortunately due to the time taken to update all the web files, you don\'t get to see the benefits as quickly as I\'d like, but it\'s on my TODO list to improve the processing. For the author reporting, shortly you should be able choose weekly and monthly summary reports, as well as the ability to switch on individual reports again. The individual reports were switched off by the testing tools, due to the number of authors that were unhappy receiving them. However, there are still several authors that would like them. If all goes well with the final round of testing, expect an announcement next week.</p>\r\n<p>We topped 143 testers submitting reports last month, so thank you once again to everyone involved.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (7,7,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Not too much has happened this month, at least not to rave about. A lot of backend fixes and abstraction of common modules into their own distribution, more tests and generally a bit of a clean up. Following some runs with <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-NYTProf\">Devel-NYTProf</a>, it highlighted a few areas where the <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org/\">Reports</a> website generation could be sped up. At first it didn\'t appear to make much of a difference, but after a week trying to catch up with itself, the generation code did start to improve considerably. To the point we now have as many as 4 updates of the backend data and websites each day. From once taking as long as 18 hours to do a daily update, the updates now take between 3-6 hours for each run. I may look at making this a little more frequent, but for now I would like to keep it stable so I can see how we fare with the current level of reporting.</p>\r\n<p>The pressure was off somewhat last month, so it was nice to have a stable base to watch and see if anything wasn\'t working as it should. It did highlight a couple of minor glitches, including incorrect permissions on the OpenThought and CGI files, but thankfully no major problems. However, that isn\'t to say there hasn\'t been a major problem, as there has, you just likely never noticed. Unfortunately the rsync to mirror CPAN, which updates the CPAN Testers BACKPAN mirror and allows CPAN Testers to run the analysis for the Uploads database, failed to update for over a week. It appears that too many people are trying to rsync from the master CPAN mirror at FUNET, and some requests were not able to be actioned. It has highlighted that the mirroring infrastructure perhaps does need a bit of a rethink. Some quite likely could be quite comfortable accessing a second tier mirror perhaps once a day, and those of us who would like to be able to update more frequently can act as secondary tiers. At the moment only BACKPAN is available from the cpantesters.org domain, but I shall be looking to allow it to also provide a public CPAN mirror too. Plus with the ability to update the data 4 times a day, I\'d like to have the mirrors update 4 times a day too. However, until the guys at FUNET are comfortable with that, it\'ll stick to once a day for now.</p>\r\n<p>I have started work on the dynamic Reports website, and it has already thrown up a bit of a quandry. How do I detect whether a request is for a Javascript enabled browser or not? It seems there is no easy method, as even though a browser may be able to handle javascript, the user may have switched it off and nothing in the HTTP request indicates that. The suggestion in many places seems to be set a cookie via javascript, but that only works if you have some sort of landing page that refreshes before loading the real page. Personally I don\'t like this, so I\'m looking to changing the URLs that will be used. The current URLs will map to the Javascript versions, with the flat HTML pages being available via a slightly different link. If there is a better way, I\'d love to hear about it.</p>\r\n<p>As I\'ve been mentioning for a while now, the <a href=\"http://qa-hackathon.org\">2009 QA Hackathon</a> event will be taking place in <strong>Birmingham, UK</strong> from <strong>Saturday March 28</strong> to <strong>Monday March 30</strong>. 3 full days of hacking on TAP, CPAN Testers and other QA and testing projects are planned, with currently 20 people in attendance. Several key collaborators involved with CPAN Testers will be there, so we\'re hoping that we can finally get CT2.0 up and working for everyone as soon as possible after the event.</p>\r\n<p>We topped 143 testers submitting reports last month, so thank you once again to everyone involved.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (8,8,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>&quot;Patience is a virtue&quot;, but not for some authors it would seem. Up until last week the Reports and Statistics sites were updated once a day, as the databases behind them were also only updated once a day. As of Monday 26th January, the updates now occur twice a day and will hopefully occur more frequently in the future, although at the moment we\'re restricted by the amount of time it takes for the Reports site to update (currently 7 hours). As a consequence the last report entered into the database can be from several hours earlier, as it takes a while for the NNTP server to catchup with the mail posts. The old site runs continuously, and thus it often picks up more recent reports sooner than the new site. However, the old site has several bugs that have been fixed in the new site, so there is a trade off. Having said that, please don\'t bug the current maintainers of the CPAN Testers ecosystem about the old site, as aside from the fact we don\'t have access to the servers, the old site will be depreciated completely once we move to CPAN Testers 2.0. with a dynamic Reports site.</p>\r\n<p>At the beginning of January the cpan-testers mailing list received it\'s 3 millionth post. Considering the 1st post was in August 1999, you might be forgiven that that is a fair number to cover just over 9 years of CPAN Testers. However, it\'s worth bearing in mind that the 2 millionth post was received in August 2008, and perhaps more significantly the 1 millionth post was in February 2008! That\'s over 1 million posts in the last 5 months, and over 2 million in the last 11 months. The growth rate of testing has been staggering in the last year, and with more people considering other platforms, I expect it to increase further this year. However, it\'s easy to spot the number of posts, as that is just the NNTP ID, but there are a number of posts that are conversations, questions, invalid reports and PAUSE upload posts, so to confirm the current status I set about writing a short program to help me calculate it all. The code has now been integrated into <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Testers-WWW-Statistics\">CPAN-Testers-WWW-Statistics</a> and the results can be seen on the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/interest.html\">Interesting Stats</a> page. As we hit the 3 million post this month, I was expecting the 3 millionth accepted report hit during February, but I should have known better :) As can now be seen from the tables, Justin Reynolds was the lucky soul to post that particular report on 21st January. The tables make interesting reading, with Chris Williams (unsurprisingly) doing his best to hit every notable entry in the database :) Incidentally, the new tables now also indicate the last report processed, so you can now know how recent the updates are.</p>\r\n<p>Also at the beginning of January, <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/~davidrw/\">David Westbrook</a> offered to help improve the test suite for <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-WWW-Testers\">CPAN-WWW-Testers</a>, which was very gratefully received. The old test suite was in need of attention, and David has managed to bring it dragging and screaming up to a much more respectable level. To highlight this, David sent me a before and after Devel::Cover comparision of his changes:</p>\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>File</th><th>stmt</th><th>bran</th><th>cond</th><th>sub</th><th>pod</th><th>time</th><th>total</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>BEFORE</td>\r\n<td>13.1</td>\r\n<td>2.6</td>\r\n<td>0.0</td>\r\n<td>49.0</td>\r\n<td>100.0</td>\r\n<td>100.0</td>\r\n<td>12.8</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>AFTER</td>\r\n<td>92.5</td>\r\n<td>58.0</td>\r\n<td>41.3</td>\r\n<td>93.9</td>\r\n<td>100.0</td>\r\n<td>100.0</td>\r\n<td>83.3</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n</table>\r\n<p>With the new tests as a base, a fresh TODO list and some free time, the codebase has been improved even further. Adding even more tests have pushed the coverage rate to over 90%, so many thanks to David for his efforts, it really is much appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>A further move towards the dynamic Reports website, has seen the introduction of a new web service. It is primarily for developers of sites that use the cpanstats data, but find the burden of grabbing the current SQLite database, or parsing YAML files a nuisance. You can now access portions of the data via an AJAX/CGI request. If you wish to find out more details, please let me know and I\'ll furnish you with how to use the service.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://qa-hackathon.org\">2009 QA Hackathon</a> event in Birmingham is drawing closer and will be featuring work on the CPAN Testers infrastructure. With several key collaborators planning to be there, we\'re hoping that a lot of the plans to get CT2.0 up and working consistently for all smokers will come to fruition.</p>\r\n<p>We topped 137 testers submitting reports last month, so thank you very much to everyone involved. The mappings this month included 36 total addresses mapped, of which 18 were for newly identified testers. This actually prompted me to think about how many new testers we actually get each month. Not only that but how many testers drop off each month too. So I\'ve now created another graph on the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/graphs.html#stats4\">Graphs</a> page, that highlights the trends. Interestingly it would appear that when we have a large number of new testers, they often only last a month. Thankfully, the general trend is good.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (9,9,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>December was quite a hive of activity, what with the new <a href=\"https://prefs.cpantesters.org\">Preferences Administration</a> site launch and the reworked <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org\">Reports</a> site also going live. There is still another member of the website family to be unveiled, but that might be a little longer arriving. In the meantime work towards CT2.0 is being seen as a higher priority for the moment. The data generation tools now encompass a MySQL database update, which is used to feed the Reports site. The first benefits from the change to the MySQL database have been to enable the new Reports site to go live, however in the longer term the AJAX API to data snippets are expected to be used on search.cpan.org, and pretty much anywhere that people can make use of it.</p>\r\n<p>A big data cleanup was also undertaken last month with several entries getting sanitised. As some of the reports get truncated or parsing fails partially, some of the fields, such as osname and osvers can often be left blank or contain erroneous data. As such cleaning this up helps to provide more accurate numbers for the different platforms. Until we move to the complete HTTP submission system, it is likely that some descrepencies will still slip through, so if you spot any please let me know and I\'ll investigate where I can.</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned last month, the <a href=\"http://qa-hackathon.org\">2009 QA Hackathon</a> event in Birmingham will be featuring work on the CPAN Testers infrastructure.

The mappings this month included 68 total addresses mapped, of which 23 were for newly identified testers.</p>\r\n<p>One side effect of being able to map so many addresses to actual people over the last year, has meant the totals per month keep getting adjusted. With the most recent mappings several months that previous listed over 130 testers, have seen their counts notably reduced, to the point that now December 2008 is the only month to have listed more than 130 testers in a month. I expect that number to reduce too once there are a few addresses mapped in the future. As a result of all the mappings recently, I\'ve held off my unmapped address mailout for the last few months, but I plan to sort that out this month. In the complete database we have 564 unmapped addresses, although only 68 were used during 2008. With a total of 2754 addresses being used, 564 is a significantly high number. My hope is that moving to the new HTTP submission system and releasing the new member of the website family will also help to reduce that number, especially those who use \'example.com\' or \'ESMTP\' as their domains. CT2.0 is coming ... soon :)</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (10,10,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>After the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/updates.html#September2008c\">last major update to CPAN Testers Reports website</a>, the plan had always been to move to a more dynamic site. While a fully fledged dynamic site is still planned, the move is being made gradually with significant updates. As such the last updates have <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org/\">now been made live</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The latest set of changes now mean that the site is now heavily reliant on Javascript running in the browser. With the previous updates and the large amount of data on some pages, the Javascript code previously used was taking a considerable amount of time to correctly render the page according to the user preferences. As such a major rethink was instigated and I\'m very grateful to <a href=\"http://perl.jonallen.info/\">JJ</a>, for providing a different perspective that has now been employed. All the data displayed is now driven by data files rather than HTML, thus allowing the pages to render much more quickly. Also to alieviate the loading on distribution pages, the display now only shows one version of a distribution at a time. In most cases this will be the latest version, but depending on your preferences this may differ slightly.</p>\r\n<p>The preferences themselves have been updated and you are now able to filter on Perl verison and operating system, so you can see the reports that are specific for your installation requirements. The preferences are also now tied to the stats and summary graphics, so updating your preferences will also update these tables too.</p>\r\n<p>The latter dynamic update, the summary graphics, now use AJAX to update the quick view of the PASS/FAIL/NA/UNKNOWN reports for the distribution versions or author distributions, depending upon which type of page you are looking at.</p>\r\n<p>This does mean that if you don\'t have Javascript enabled in your browser then you are unlikely to experience the site as it was meant to be viewed. The next phased released however, will included a graceful downgrade to allow each page to be rendered as a flat HTML page with the ability to submit your choices of preferences via a traditional form. With the Googlebot and MSNbot hitting the site on a regular basis, it\'s likely that they will be harnessed to rebuild the site in future too. More updates coming soon.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (11,11,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>With no little amount of fanfare the CPAN Testers would like to unveil a new site to accompany the rest of the family.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://prefs.cpantesters.org\">The CPAN Testers Preferences Administration website</a> is now available for authors to specify the preferences they would like to set for the receipt of reports and summaries. The site now drives the Daily Summary Reports that are produced by the Author Notification System. Currently only Daily Summaries are available, but as the system settles in, the ability to provide individual reports and Weekly Summaries will also be available.</p>\r\n<p>The preferences are separated into two sections, the default preferences and the distribution preferences. The default preferences are applied when you have no specific distribution preferences defined. It is here you can also switch off the ability to receive reports at all, if you wish not to be bothered with CPAN Testers. The distribution preferences can be defined for each distribution which you have released to CPAN. If you choose to only define specific preferences for some of your distributions, the remainder will use the default preferences.</p>\r\n<p>The preferences themselves allow you to specify which grades you are interested in, whether you wish to just be alerted to the first or all tuples, where a tuple is an instance of Distribution version, Perl version and Operating System. You can elect to just be notified about the latest release of a distribution or all versions, as well as the Perl versions and operating systems which you wish to be alerted to, or conversely not be alerted to.</p>\r\n<p>As the system is only meant for CPAN authors, the backend is driven by your PAUSE credentials. However, please note that your password is never stored by the system, and is only used to verify your login with PAUSE itself (all over SSL).</p>\r\n<p>One important note I would like to make authors aware of, is that if you are not receiving summaries, then login to the site and find all notifications have been disabled without you previously asking me to, you may want to check your PAUSE account directly. The system uses your \'PAUSEID at cpan.org\' mailing address to send reports, and as such if you haven\'t correctly set up a forwarding mail address within PAUSE (it doesn\'t appear to be a default setting), then persistant bounces will disable all notifications within your account. Once you correct the PAUSE forwarding, you can then enable notifications and should then begin receiving summaries, as per your preferences.</p>\r\n<p>If you find any problems in using the system. please me know.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (12,12,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>November was very much a development period for CPAN Testers. There has been a lot of work going on in the backend, with Ask working on the new backend database and HTTP submission process, and myself working on several sites, including 2 new ones. There has also been some work by David Golden and Chris Williams on the smoker tools, so although we may have been publicly quiet, there has been a lot of effort being put in to push CPAN Testers forward.</p>\r\n<p>One of the new sites, The <a href=\"http://prefs.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Preferences</a> site is now ready to go. We finally got the SSL Certifcate approved, signed and installed, so look for a bigger announcement next week about that. The site will allow authors to set preference filters for the reporting they currently receive via the Author Notification Service. Currently only Daily Summary Reports are available, but this will be extended to the individual reports as well as Weekly Summary Reports, as soon as I have some time to add those reports in.</p>\r\n<p>The more interesting site to be worked on is the main <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Reports</a> site. Following on from my use.perl post regarding Sorting CPAN, the backend code now uses the new database to correctly sort distribution versions. However, the biggest change to be made will be to make the site very dependant on Javascript. There is already Javascript on the site at the moment, but it wasn\'t written well enough to cope with some of the HUGE pages, and as such some author and distribution pages suffer from popups asking the user whether they wish to continue a long running script. This has now been resolved, and the new pages load a lot faster. In addition the filter mechanism has now been extended to include the ability to filter on the perl version and/or OS name. There is still a bit of work still be done, but again expect an announcement regarding the site in the next couple of weeks.</p>\r\n<p>One thing to note about the <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org\">Reports</a> site, is that I am not currently coding it as I would a static site. If you don\'t have javascript enabled, then you will not be able to see the data. Once the dynamic site is available then a flat HTML version will be possible, together with the provision for AJAX requests to view specific results on your site.</p>\r\n<p>At the London Perl Workshop, both Chris Williams and myself gave CPAN Testers related talks. Chris gave a more up to date version of the talk he present at YAPC::Europe in Copenhagen during the summer, while I presented a behind the scenes look at the files used to present CPAN, BACKPAN and parts of the CPAN Testers site, finishing up with the new Uploads Database. The event went very well and by all accounts all the talks were very well received. No doubt a few CPAN Testers talks will feature in some of the workshops and conferences during 2009 too.</p>\r\n<p>One event that will be featuring the CPAN Testers project, will be the <a href=\"http://qa-hackathon.org\">2009 QA Hackathon</a>. This is being held in Birmingham, and although this is a very dedicated event to bring together the developers involved in QA projects, if you have suggestions for attendees, would like to nominate a person we should contact, or even better still have a sponsor contact, then please visit the wiki and add a post to the site.</p>\r\n<p>We topped 133 testers submitting reports last month, our highest ever, so thank you very much to everyone involved.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (13,13,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>One of the problems with the <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers</a> website resources, is that where an author listing of distributions, or the list of versions for a distribution, is required, a lot of backend trawling is done. This is due to the current backends having to refer to 3 sources to get those lists. Even then the resulting lists aren\'t quite correct, as the version sorting can be slightly weird when you have to take into account every author has slightly different perception of versioning. Sort::Versions goes a long way, but it isn\'t 100% accurate. The only really accurate way of sorting is on the release date of a distribution, which until now hasn\'t existed in a single form.</p>\r\n<p>For a couple of months now, CPAN Testers has had it\'s own BACKPAN and CPAN mirrors. Of the 3 sources these are represented by Parse::BACKPAN::Packages and Parse::CPAN::Distributions. and the 2 index files they use. These can take a long time to parse, and as they don\'t parse and return any release date for distributions and their version, using Sort::Versions is a reasonable alternative. However, there is a third source and that is the CPAN Uploads that are announced by PAUSE. Due to the time lag of the mirrors, very often a release can be made and not be available to CPAN for several hours, so while no CPAN Testers reports might exist, it\'s still important to know the latest version.</p>\r\n<p>Previously the last source is the only one that contained any release date information, which prompted me to think about doing it for the other sources. Surprisingly quickly, using the local CPAN Testers copies of BACKPAN and CPAN, I was able to build a basic database of upload data, and tag each with \'backpan\', \'cpan\' or \'upload\', to indicate in what state the release was currently at. Queries now take fractions of seconds instead of several seconds. But, and perhaps more importantly, the sorting of distributions actually makes more sense!</p>\r\n<p>The new database is being integrated into the backend code at the moment, but for those that might wish to have this information available for their own uses, the complete database is publicly available at the following locations:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>SQLite =&gt; <a href=\"http://devel.cpantesters.org/uploads/uploads.db.gz\">Gzip</a> (2.2MB) / <a href=\"http://devel.cpantesters.org/uploads/uploads.db.bz2\">Bzip2</a> (1.8MB)</li>\r\n<li>CSV =&gt; <a href=\"http://devel.cpantesters.org/uploads/uploads.csv.gz\">Gzip</a> (1.5MB) / <a href=\"http://devel.cpantesters.org/uploads/uploads.csv.bz2\">Bzip2</a> (1.2MB)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These will now be updated daily, and once everything else is in place will eventually updated hourly.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (14,14,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>At the beginning of the last month, my automated mailer for authors and testers went live. For the most part many will never see the mails it produces, which is good, as it will mean that authors are uploading packages nicely formatted, and testers aren\'t sending out mangled reports. There have been an average of 3 or 4 authors a month who upload distributions without an archive extension accepted by CPAN/CPANPLUS or missing a version number. With testers it varies depending whether a bogus upload has filtered through the system, but again there are at least a few a month. This check now runs daily, as opposed to when I ran it manually roughly once a month. As a consequence it will hopefully help authors more quickly to know when they have uploaded a package that wasn\'t quite packaged correctly, and help testers spot when their test queue has got a bad package. If you do receive a mail from the system and don\'t believe your package/report should have been included, please let me know. It should be noted that authors can upload any archive format they choose, or any file format for that matter. However, to be most useful to end users, particularly those using the automated tools such as CPAN.pm and CPANPLUS, it is recommended that the following archive formats are used: .tar.gz, tgz, .tar.bz2 and .zip. In addition the format for a reliable upload is &lt;code&gt;-.&lt;/code&gt;.</p>\r\n<p>Also at the beginning of the month, we had a slight hiccup with the update to the Reports site. Unfortunately L&eacute;on was in the process of moving his server and the file used by Parse-BACKPAN-Packages became unavailable. Leon quickly sent me a copy of the file and I pointed the code at a local copy of the file instead of the remote one. However, it did prompt me to think about possibly running a mirror BACKPAN server, and thus creating the file myself. At least that way if anything happens to Leon\'s server, there is an alternative location from which the file can be grabbed from. Once I\'ve got it working to my satisfaction, I\'ll shall implement a patch to Parse-BACKPAN-Packages so that it knows about alternative locations. As a consequence, this new BACKPAN mirror is now available publicly via http://backpan.cpantesters.org.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Wiki</a> got an update this month too. Following some XHTML fixes and a little bit of a code clean up, I also added syndication feeds for the Recent Changes, as requested by David Golden. The fixes to the XHTML templates, CSS and RSS have hopefully helped to provide a cleaner interface.</p>\r\n<p>Between 13th and 19th October there were some signification changes to the infrastructure of CPAN Testers. The fact that nobody appears to have noticed was a good thing. Expect an official announce soon :)</p>\r\n<p>Over the course of the month, JJ came up with an alternative method of displaying the reports information on the Reports website. Many authors have complained (loudly), that due to the large number of reports their distributions have amassed, it gets difficult to see the important data from the irrelavent (to them). As a first attempt to minimise this the default selections within the Javascript ensured that only CPAN available distributions, tested against unpatched versions of Perl, were seen on each page. However, this also has the problem that for large listings the Javascript can still take a large amount of time to render the page correctly. For some visitors it can also be a bit disconcerting when the page initially locks while it runs the javascript, then half of the page suddenly disappears. This was always a short term measure, and following discussions with JJ, he has come up with a solution that uses a JSON data file, which loads in the browser with the predefined defaults. The new default will be to ONLY render the current distribution, with the ability to &quot;Expand All&quot; should you wish to see the other distribution versions. This will then mean no disappearing report data and no long running javascript. My thanks to JJ for persisting with this and figuring out the best way to render everything. The changes aren\'t live yet, but expect an update at some point this month.</p>\r\n<p>Other website developments have continued at quite a pace and while some work has mostly been to improve XHTML compatibility and fixes cosmetic bugs, the new sites for Report Administration and Author Reporting Preferences are coming along very well. More news on those in the coming weeks. The CPAN Testers git repository has now been live for several weeks and will be expanding once more of the backend tools and code are cleaned up and packaged.</p>\r\n<p>Again we had 126 testers submitting reports last month, our second highest by month, with 16 new addresses mapped, of which we had 6 new testers identified.</p>\r\n<p>Work continues on for the websites and mailing systems along with numerous other changes within the CPAN Testers ecosystem. More news soon.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (15,15,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Well a lot has been happening this month! After a quiet revamp of the Statistics website, the work to complete the revamped <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org/\">Reports site</a> continued on. At least for a few days. Following some rather large threads on the perl-qa mailing list, it was decided that part of the change for CPAN Testers, to bring about a centralised author notification system, should be brought forward. With the increased volume of reports and the fact that some authors are uninterested in the reports as a whole, <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/updates.html#September2008a\">a daily summary report was generated</a>, as part of the Authors Notification System, and a new version of Test-Reporter was released, which would stop smoke testers sending reports directly to the authors. However, this turn of events also received an equal if not bigger resistance, as a number of authors requested to have their direct mails turned back on! Unfortunately, we won\'t be turning them back on (yet!), but we do have plans to enable the direct mails to those authors who want them, by way of the Preferences system, which will be launched as soon as we have the pieces in place. This was to be part of a major CPAN Testers 2.0 launch, but it looks like we may end up releasing parts in stages now. However, if an author wishes to still receive these emails in the short term, they can download David Golden\'s <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-CPAN-Testers-Remailer/\">App-CPAN-Testers-Remailer</a>, and configure it to read the NNTP server as and when it updates.</p>\r\n<p>The new <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org/\">Reports</a> site has now <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/updates.html#September2008c\">finally been launched</a>, and initial feedback was positive. There are still some improvements to be made, but after 3 months of solid work, please don\'t expect anything soon. The biggest drawback with the current static site, is that it creates 3.7GB worth of files, and takes several hours just to generate those files that need updating each day. The dynamic site will improve on this considerably, by only caching files that are actually requested. In addition the preferences system can then use AJAX calls to update the page rather than trying to load everything up front. This will then mean that the update system can be made much more responsive, and once the full HTTP submission system is working, the websites can be updated every few hours. Though perhaps more importantly, those authors who wish to receive reports the moment they hit the server, can then open the floodgates to their own mailservers as much as they want ;)</p>\r\n<p>Chris and David have been hard at work releasing updates to <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPANPLUS-YACSmoke\">CPANPLUS-YACSmoke</a> and <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Reporter\">CPAN-Reporter</a> respectively, with David also patching CPAN.pm and CPANPLUS to implement some of the fixes to the toolchain for testers. The testing tools have moved on leaps and bounds within the last year, and setting up an automated smoke tester is now much easier than it once was. With David and Chris being much more responsive to the updates of the smoke test tools at the moment, it should be noted that CPAN-YACSmoke hasn\'t had much attention from Rob or myself. There is a version 0.04 in existence privately, which may see a final release, but largely the plan is to move any useful functionality into CPANPLUS-YACSmoke, where Chris can look after it more attentively.</p>\r\n<p>One of the changes implemented by David, was following a clarification by Graham Barr over the use of the UNKNOWN grade. For the last few years it has been taken to mean that the test suite could not be found for the distribution, and therefore it is unknown whether the distribution passes or not. However, Graham has since stated that the grade was to also include those instances in the build stage where something goes wrong that is unclear whether the fault is with the distribution, environment, a prerequisite or something else. Previously the build stage errors were reported as FAIL, and have been a great cause of debate for authors when FAILs appear that were out of their control. The reassignment to UNKNOWN will hopefully allow authors to ignore these reports, and for testers to investigate further whether they need to fix their own environment or send a specific bug report. Following on from this, David Golden has written a &quot;nagbot&quot; that will be emailing testers to alert them when their testing environment need upgrading.</p>\r\n<p>Another quiet launch was the <a href=\"http://devel.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Development Site</a>. This is a central resource that is updated daily with the data files and source code snapshots for the collection of CPAN Testers websites, so you have a central source to refer to. However, for the source code repositories for the whole CPAN Testers ecosystem, you should refer to the <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/Contributing\">Contributing</a> page of the <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers Wiki</a>. Here you will find all the known repositories for the smoke testing tools and website generation tools. Patches, as always, are welcome, so if you feel a burning desire to fix some part of the system, now you know where to find the latest code versions.</p>\r\n<p>Again we had over 100 testers submitting reports last month, with 23 new addresses mapped, of which we had 15 new testers identified. Rick Myers, a recent addition to the CPAN Testers community, caught out Chris with an extra 481 reports to become top tester of the month, and we\'ve seen a slight rise in testers last month too, with 120 posting reports.</p>\r\n<p>I expect a quiet a month for October, as we let the dust settle and allow David to follow Chris (nothing new there then ;)) and become a new Dad. That\'s not to say we will be idle, as there is still plenty to be getting on with, as we move closer to CT2.0.</p>',NULL);

There are plenty of changes and fixes that have gone into this release, and my thanks specifically to <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong> and <strong>David E. Wheeler</strong> for contributing patches.</p>\r\n<p>So what do you get with the new site? Well thanks to Gabor, a pass matrix has been added to each distribution page. On each author page, the distributions now link to their own respective pages. David E Wheeler\'s patch has been incorporated to provide an RSS feed that excludes the PASS reports. In addition the RSS feeds now limit to at most the last 100 reports. For the author page, the very latest release is listed, and not just the latest with reports, so authors can see more immediately whether their latest version is known about. On the distribution page, all known releases are listed, with those having no reports having text saying that. This latter change has been a cause for concern with some authors, as the latest versions were often getting missed. Unfortunately this was due to everything being referenced as per the BACKPAN files, and did not include everything that was still on CPAN. There have been many minor fixes, which all help to contribute to better usability.</p>\r\n<p>However, the biggest change is the ability to select what you wish to see on the page. The options currently available are only the beginning, as these were all the easy ones to sort out. More complex changes, such as being able to filter on OS and/or Perl version, and preferences cookie recording, are planned for a later release along with many other improvements. Although the most notable change will be to turn the site into a dynamic one, which will be able to respond to new reports much more immediately.</p>\r\n<p>If you do have further suggestions for improvement, please post them to <a href=\"http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=CPAN-WWW-Testers\">RT</a>, so I don\'t forget them.</p>\r\n<p>For those that are wondering what has happened to the testers.db.bz2 file, that file is no longer generated for the new site, as it doesn\'t contain enough data for the current cpantesters.org sites. The new file is at h<a>ttp://devel.cpantesters.org/cpanstats.db.gz</a>, and contains several changes from the previous schema. To see the current schema, see <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::WWW::Testers::Generator\">CPAN::WWW::Testers::Generator</a>. In the short term, if you still need the old schema formatted database file you can grab it from <a href=\"http://cpantesters.perl.org/testers.db.bz2\">http://cpantesters.perl.org/testers.db.bz2</a>. The old site is currently maintained by Robert and Ask at perl.org and will continue to be updated as per the old schema until at least the new site has had a chance to settle down, and probably not until there is a more interactive API available to the data. However, if you are using the old database, please think about moving over to the new format, as the contents of the new database are now more actively monitored and maintained.</p>\r\n<p>And latestly a request. Assuming nothing breaks and the new changes work out, the definitive domain for all the CPAN Testers related websites should be cpantesters.org. As such, if you have documentation in your modules or on your websites that references any other domain (whether for the Reports site or the Statistics site for example), could you update them to use only the cpantesters.org domain, with the correct sub-domain (Reports is <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org\">www.cpantesters.org</a>, Statistics is <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org\">stats.cpantesters.org</a> and the Wiki is <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org\">wiki.cpantesters.org</a>, etc.), for your next release. The reason being that other domain names may or may not work in the future, and the use of the new domain name will make it easier for everyone to remember the sites they wish to go to for anything related to CPAN Testers. It also doesn\'t hurt having all these references adding to search engine rankings either.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (17,17,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Yesterday I announced the launch of the notification system (with very mixed reactions), part of a whole swathe of improvements planned for CPAN Testers. The next phase for the notification system is to implement a preferences website, on which authors can fine tune the alerting they wish to receive, even down to particular os, perl version, distribution and distribution version. So for example if an author wants to receive mails for their distributions, except their Acme ones, or only for those reports run on VMS, then they can. I\'m not going to commit to when the preferences site will be live, as there is much work behind the scenes still yet to do, but all being well I plan to have something live in the coming months.</p>\r\n<p>Since taking on the code base for <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-WWW-Testers-Generator\">CPAN-WWW-Testers-Generator</a> and <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-WWW-Testers\">CPAN-WWW-Testers</a>, I have been hard at work implementing many improvements for these, as well as packaging <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Testers-WWW-Statistics\">CPAN-Testers-WWW-Statistics</a>. You may not have noticed the improvements in the database generation tools and process, but you may have noticed some of the clean ups on the Statistics site. One of these clean-ups has been to finally add an <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/rss-2.0.xml\">RSS feed</a> and formalise <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/updates.html\">the blog</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Another update has been to move the non-CPAN code and data to a new <a href=\"http://devel.cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers Development</a> site. My primary intention with this is to provide links to the data that is used or generated behind the scenes, that isn\'t appropriate for CPAN. However, a further intention is to provide a suitable one-hit place to find all the development links you will need if you wish to get involved in working with the CPAN Testers code base. At the moment only links to the CPAN versions are included, but eventually git/svn/cvs/whatever repositories will also be listed. This will hopefully encourage patches and the like for adding more functionality to the websites and bring us closer to CPAN Testers 2.0.</p>\r\n<p>However, there is still one part of the puzzle to be unveiled, and that is the new CPAN Testers Reports website. On Monday I gave a quick preview to <a href=\"http://miltonkeynes.pm.org/\">MiltonKeynes.pm</a>, which gained some positive comments, and will hopefully meet with approval with everyone else (though I doubt it after the flak I\'ve been getting over the past week) once it receives its finishing touches. The site currently builds to over 3.7GB as a static site, so the move to a dynamic site will reduce that somewhat. Lots of fixes for the static site have been implemented, and many more are still planned. Expect its public launch soon.</p>\r\n<p>There is lots more planned for CPAN Testers 2.0, but much of that will be behind the scenes in the way that reports get sent to the central server. If you want to get involved and help improve CPAN Testers, please consider joining the <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/MailingLists\">cpan-testers-discuss mailing list</a>.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (18,18,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Today I\'m pleased to announce the launch of the CPAN Testers\' &quot;Collated Email Notification of Tester Reports for Authors Service&quot; [1], a centralised notification system to send authors email updates for the reports, that were previously sent by testers to the authors directly. David has now <a href=\"http://use.perl.org/~dagolden/journal/37377\">updated Test-Reporter</a> to suppress the sending of mails to authors, and the CPAN Tester community are currently upgrading their environments with the latest version. As such the current direct mails should now tail off, with the new notification system taking over.</p>\r\n<p>Following some heated discussions last week, part of the plans for CPAN Testers 2.0 have been brought forward. As much of the data recording and presentation is already fairly centralised, it has long been planned to make the author notificatons more centralised to provide more consistent reporting. Due to some very heated threads recently, David Golden and myself decided we should look at putting a centralised email alerting system into place sooner rather than later. David has been looking at alerting testers to broken environments, old CPAN Testers tools and badly formed reports, which will hopefully be live soon, while I have taken on the first part of the whole author notification and preferences system.</p>\r\n<p>The prototype for alerting authors went live this lunchtime (UK time), though if you haven\'t received an email yet, don\'t fret it is just likely that none of your distributions have been tested since Saturday in order to receive the mails. As this is just the first part of the full preferences system, I\'ve had to set some defaults. These have been set to notify authors of the FAIL reports, which are the FIRST instance of a distribution/platform/perl combination. Currently all the known PAUSE ids have been entered into the database with these defaults, apart from a few authors who have expressed other default preferences. If you do not wish to receive these alerts, or would like to alter the preferences, please send me an email (barbie[at]cpan.org) and I\'ll make the updates as requested.</p>\r\n<p>The notification system will run once a day and collate a list of the links to the reports via the web interface on the NNTP server. As such, you will no longer receive huge reports in your inbox, but at most just one email a day containing a list of links to your reports. You can then view them at your leisure. If you have any problems with the notifications themselves, please let me know, and I would welcome any suggestions for improvements. I may not be able to implement them straight away (and may already have some on my TODO list), but please feel free to email me privately, comment here, or join the <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/MailingLists\">cpan-testers-discuss mailing list</a> and join the dicussions.</p>\r\n<p>[1] If you can think of a suitable word beginning with \'L\' to replace \'Service\' let me know ;)</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (19,19,2,2,0,NULL,'<p>This month we hit the 2 millionth post to cpan-testers, thanks to Chris Williams. I congratulated him after his talk in Copenhagen, but he was more relieved to find out that the report itself was a PASS :) I still need to check which was the 2 millionth verified report, but I suspect Chris will claim that too. With such a high volume of reports, it\'s getting more urgent to move to something other than SMTP. There have been further discussions about updating the transport method and hopefully there should be some movement on that during the latter part of the year. In the meantime, if you\'re interested in getting involved in the way CPAN Testers gets reported in the future, feel free to join cpan-testers-discuss@perl.org, and add your thoughts.</p>\r\n<p>Having taken over the code that runs the CPAN Testers Reports website, I have been hard at work behind the scenes updating all the code that generates the database and websites. As the CPAN Testers Statistics site worked from an enhanced version of the database, the first hurdle has been to merge the two and ensure both websites can be rebuilt from the same database. Despite a few hiccups with the NNTP server, that part of the process has gone very well. As a consequence several code releases of <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-WWW-Testers-Generator\">CPAN-WWW-Testers-Generator</a> have already hit CPAN. The code for the Reports and Statistics site is currently being packaged and will be released soon too. The two sites meanwhile are being heavily tested with the new database, and again all seems to be running smoothly. For some thoughts into my plans for the future of the Reports site, see my <a href=\"http://use.perl.org/~barbie/journal/37258\">use.perl posting</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Last month featured an excursion by many testers to Copenhagen, for the annual <a href=\"http://www.yapceurope2008.org/\">YAPC::Europe Perl Conference</a>. <a href=\"http://barbie.missbarbell.co.uk/photo/9014\">Chris Williams</a> presented <a href=\"http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1359\">\'Rough Guide to CPAN Testing\'</a>, and we held a <a href=\"http://barbie.missbarbell.co.uk/photo/9095\">CPAN</a> <a href=\"http://barbie.missbarbell.co.uk/photo/9096\">Testers</a> <a href=\"http://barbie.missbarbell.co.uk/photo/9097\">BOF</a> at the end of the first day. We had several people along to discuss several aspects of CPAN testing, and Adam Kennedy\'s PITA idea also got a lot of interest. After the BOF we managed to get a <a href=\"images/ye2008-cpan-testers.jpg\">group photo</a> of some of the testers. Next year I hope it will be an even bigger collection of testers :)</p>\r\n<p>Both at the end of Chris\' talk and during the first set of Lightning Talks, JJ and I announced that with the support of Birmingham.pm, we would be hosting the second <a href=\"http://qa-hackathon.org\">QA Hackathon</a> in Birmingham. We have already spoken to several people, who we hope will be able to attend, and we\'re hoping a few others will also be able to get involved too. More details will be announced in due course, but expect more CPAN Testers work to be involved in the hackathon.</p>\r\n<p>Again we had over 100 testers submitting reports last month, with 49 new addresses mapped, of which we had 16 new testers identified. Once I\'ve got the current work out of the way, my plan is to graph the number of new and core testers we see each month. I\'m interested to see what effect the promotion of CPAN Testers at major events, or significant online promotions, have on the uptake of new testers. After that I hope to look at the platforms tested in a little more depth.</p>\r\n<p>While trawling the back catalogue of articles on the NNTP server, in order to verify the database was building correctly, I uncovered a couple of posts from Brian King; <a href=\"http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2002/07/msg46171.html\">FAQ First Draft Thread</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2002/07/msg46794.html\">FAQ Second Draft Thread</a>.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (20,20,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>First off an apology. It seems that I used a legitimate email address in a rant back last year, about the use of tester email addresses. At the time, the address didn\'t appear to be real and had given the impression that the address was being used as a spamtrap. The owner of the address has since contacted me to inform me that it is real, and that it doesn\'t get used as a spamtrap. So my sincere apologies to Rob for casting doubt on his email address. However, the address in question had caused confusion, so Rob has kindly altered the address he now sends from, so that authors can feel more comfortable about sending any queries to him. Many thanks to Rob for this.</p>\r\n<p>At the beginning of the month, I <a href=\"http://use.perl.org/~barbie/journal/36862\">launched a new domain</a> for CPAN Testers, cpantesters.org. The new domain will hopefully prove more helpful in remembering all the sites used in the CPAN Testers family of sites, and maybe even start including a whole bunch of new ones. In order to make it even more easier to find other sites, linking between the sites with a standard dropdown is now planned, thanks to the suggestions of a few people. The reports site is currently receiving an update and will be rsync\'ing to the public site soon.</p>\r\n<p>August sees many of us here in Europe heading to Copenhagen, for the annual <a href=\"http://www.yapceurope2008.org/\">YAPC::Europe Perl Conference</a>. On the first day of the event, on Wednesday 13th August, <a href=\"http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/user/1449\">Chris Williams</a> will be presenting <a href=\"http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/talk/1359\">\'Rough Guide to CPAN Testing\'</a>, with a <a href=\"http://www.yapceurope2008.org/ye2008/wiki?node=CPANTestersBOF\">CPAN Testers BOF</a> planned at the end of the day, so be sure to come along to find out more. I\'m also hoping to add to my collection of photos of CPAN Testers, so please make sure you come and say hello to me during the conference if you are a CPAN Tester.</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned last month, Leon has given me the go ahead to update the code behind the scenes for the data collection and creation of the reports site. The first part of the switch over was to merge the code that does the data collection, with the previously forked code that is currently used by the Statistics site and CPAN Dependencies site. When I forked, there were a few fields that weren\'t previously being recorded that were needed (e.g. the tester email address) and a few that weren\'t used by the stats site that were dropped. Rather than having two separate systems it makes sense to merge these changes. Plus in the last month or so, I\'ve picked up on reports that were sent in Base64 or Quoted-Printable that were previously not being record properly. There are some further changes, such as the fact that the stats database also parses the UPLOAD articles, and a whole bunch of new tests, which have resulted in quite a nicely packaged little distribution. Before launching it on the world, I\'m running it in by generating the database from scratch for all articles. Originally I was going to drop the creation of the articles database, which is held locally, but decided to keep it, as it makes look ups a lot quicker. However, it\'s currently over 7GB and is still not half of the way through the rebuild! The lastest complete stats database is just over 400MB, and is much more manageable. Thankfully disk space isn\'t an issue yet, but as a consequence I\'ve made the creation of the articles database optional. Assuming anyone else is mad enough to try and generate this stuff ;)</p>\r\n<p>This time next month, I hope to having all the CPAN Testers sites running off the same database, and will hopefully have the updated reports site online for all. Thanks again to everyone for the patches, ideas and support. It\'s much appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>Again we had over 100 testers submitting reports last month, with 43 new addresses mapped, of which we had 7 new testers identified. After David Golden\'s magnificent effort last month, his bots have settled down now to a more sedate pace. As a consequence Chris has once again taken the top spot this month, and has even posted his highest number of reports in a single month. No doubt he\'s been getting his daughter to help out while he\'s been at work ;)</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (21,21,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Largely thanks to <em>David Golden</em>, we seem to have broken all records again. David already warned me at the end of May that he was planning to top 100,000 reports in a month, and 3 weeks into June he did just that, after which he started aiming for 150,000! With 138,311 reports finally submitted, David is now our top monthly tester, with Chris and Andreas vying for second place. Although it has to said that Chris does have rather a good excuse for not meeting David\'s challenge last month, as his latest project, <a href=\"http://use.perl.org/~BinGOs/journal/36827\">Niamh Olivia Williams</a>, was born last Wednesday. Apparently Chris has machines prepped and ready for her to help him pass David for July ;)</p>\r\n<p>Right across the board, the reports have all hit their highs, with a total of 262,817 reports being submitted during the month. The stats website suffered a little with the daily updates, although this was due to two different parsing errors that surfaced in a few reports, which have now been fixed. The daily updates now seem to be running nice and smoothly, and I\'m now looking to finish off some further automation work.</p>\r\n<p>Another of our top testers, <em>Jon Allen</em>, has also helped to identify Mac OS X versions that don\'t see much testing. While Leopard (the latest release) has some testing on 5.10.0 and 5.8.8, it would be beneficial to see a lot more, for those releases of the perl interpreter. Tiger is seeing the majority of testing, with 5.10.0 and 5.8.8 making up the bulk of reports, so a few more on 5.8.7 and 5.8.6 would be good to see. Lastly, Panther testing seems to concentrate on 5.8.1, 5.8.2 and 5.8.3, and would definitely benefit from more testing on later releases of Perl. Jon has written a script that I hope to adapt to provide a better breakdown for other OSs in future updates.</p>\r\n<p>June also featured <a href=\"http://conferences.mongueurs.net/yn2008/\">YAPC::NA</a> in Chicago, where I presented <a href=\"http://birmingham.pm.org/talks/barbie/cpantester2/slides.html\">&quot;How To Be A CPAN Tester&quot;</a>. The talk was mostly a brief introduction to CPAN Testing, with several references to the installation and configuration of the tools on the wiki, plus a list of the community websites used. The talk appeared to go down well, and at the BOF later the same day, I got a few interested parties that were looking to setup a CPAN testing box of some sort. Hopefully this also means we\'ll be getting another Sun machine to test with a variety of perls too. Next month <em>Chris Williams</em> will be giving his version of the talk at <a href=\"http://www.yapceurope2008.org/\">YAPC::Europe</a> in Copenhagen.</p>\r\n<p>During my talk in Chicago, I also announced that L&eacute;on Brocard, who has been looking after the CPAN Testers Reports site for several years, has <a href=\"http://use.perl.org/~barbie/journal/36774\">handed the reins over to me</a>. After which it seems there was a lot of interest in improving the report capabilities of the site. Gabor Szabo and Adam Kennedy had ideas for updating the site, and &#1497;&#1493;&#1489;&#1500; &#1511;&#1493;&#1490;\'&#1502;&#1503; (Yuval Kogman, aka nothingmuch) has also since hinted at some ideas too, so over the coming months expect some additional functionality to appear, plus further intergration with some of the other CPAN Tester sites. My thanks to L&eacute;on for keeping the site going for all these years and for the major improvements he made, particularly with the use of the YUI colour charts. You can also blame him for getting me involved with CPAN Testers in the first place, after his BOF presentation in 2003 at YAPC::Europe in Paris :)</p>\r\n<p>Again we had over 100 testers submitting reports last month, with 20 new addresses mapped, of which we had 12 new testers identified. In addition, with so many addresses unmatched, I reran a check through the complete set of reports to see if I could find some matches for addresses from old reports. The result was a further mapping of 48 addresses. I suspect some of the still unmatched addresses from the early days of reporting have long since fallen into disuse, so it\'s unlikely that I\'ll be able to resolve them. However, if you were a CPAN Tester, especially from 1999 to about 2003, although later is good too, please check the leader board and see if any of your old addresses appear in the list. Let me know, and I\'ll update the lists.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (22,22,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Once again Andreas took a stab at gaining on Chris, and for the second time in recent times, managed to submit the most reports for this month. It\'s impressive to see that all the major testers are running multiple test environments, to help cover multiple platform/perl combinations. There are roughly 1000 basic setups possible, with many more variations with libraries and compilers, etc, so although we\'re certainly making quite an impact, we\'re still a long way from covering the whole matrix. So if you do have a spare box, please think whether it could help with CPAN Testers coverage.</p>\r\n<p>Once again the testers have broken several previous records. New reports topped 176793 for last month, with all the variations, PASS, FAIL, NA and UNKNOWN all seeing their highest counts since CPAN Testers records began. It would have been nice to see the FAIL and UNKNOWN counts not increase, but they\'re still fairly consistent at 13% of the total. Andreas raised the barrier a little higher, having submitted 54764 reports last month. So far he\'s the only tester to have broken the 50,000 barrier ... twice. However, I suspect that some testers will be pushing 100,000 reports by the end of the year.</p>\r\n<p>This month we\'ve had 14 further addresses added to the list, which includes 7 new testers, giving us the second highest number of testers, 117, in a month. One of the new testers, Jon Allen, you might also know as the guy behind the facelift of <a href=\"http://perldoc.perl.org\">perldoc.perl.org</a>, as well as being another Birmingham.pm\'er. Jon happened to notice that there weren\'t a lot of Mac reports, so offered to give the CPAN Testers ago. He wrote up his experience of installing and configuring <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::Reporter::Smoker\">CPAN::Reporter::Smoker</a>, which you can <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/CPANReporterSmokerLong\">read</a> on the <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Wiki</a>. If you\'re interested in setting up a similar automated testing bot, it\'s a good howto. In the coming months I shall endeavour to write a similar one for <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::YACSmoke\">CPAN::YACSmoke</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Notice any significant difference in the stats site these days? For those that haven\'t, the site is now updated some time after 2am (Central European Time) every day. After regularly tinkering with the scripts behind the scenes to make the database more reliable on a daily basis, has now meant I can make the switch to running a site refresh on a daily basis too. With that done, I\'m now looking at automating the Bad Upload and Bad Report emails that I send out every month. This will hopefully help authors to quickly spot when they\'ve uploaded a badly formatted distribution, rather having to wait for weeks to be alerted, and for testers to quickly block testing certain distributions by updating the configuration. In the longer term I\'d also like to have a report parser that can quickly spot where a testbot has gone rogue, thus alerting the tester to investigate quickly. This will then hopefully give authors a bit more confidence in the system, so they don\'t ignore reports out of hand.</p>\r\n<p>A further addition to the site came last week, with the &quot;<a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/cpanmail.html\">Find A Tester</a>&quot; feature. As several authors are now reading the web interface for the NNTP server, they are finding it difficult to figure out who the tester is for their distributions, particularly when the reports don\'t get mailed to them. As such I\'ve set up a simple script behind the scenes that does the correct lookup. Hopefully by requesting the NNTP ID of the report, this will avoid me having to put restrictive spam measures on the script. If you intend to use the form, please use it wisely.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (23,23,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Not to be out done after last month, Chris has once again stepped up his testing, with Andreas closely following his heels. Slaven has also dramatically ramped up his testing, and the top 3 testers are now producing over 20,000 reports more than their nearest rivals. The totals didn\'t quite beat last month\'s records, but it was still a phenomenal month nonetheless.</p>\r\n<p>After suggestions from several people, I revised the graphs of the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/graphs.html\">Graphs</a> page. Using the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/chart/\">Google Chart API</a> (as suggested by <a href=\"http://use.perl.org/~simonm/\">simonm</a>), I managed to generate some better graphs, however, with the extreme values in the data and the large amount of data, the first attempts resulted in errors. As such the main graph is now only for the uploads, reports and passes, while the last graph now lists all the non-pass results. The presentation is much better than the previous attempts with GD and I\'ve been quite impressed with the Chart API. I might start looking at some other forms of the charts in the coming months.</p>\r\n<p>Earle also suggested I sort out the numbering in the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/rmatrix.html\">matrices</a>, which seemed a reasonable requested, so I\'ve also fixed that too :)</p>\r\n<p>Following my half yearly request to unknown testers, I received 8 responses, which have been added to the addresses list, together with 20 further address additions, 3 of which are from new testers.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (24,24,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Well someone has finally blown Chris Williams out of the water. Chris was steadfastly producing his 30,000+ reports as he\'s been doing for the past 5 months, but after tipping him off a while back about  Andreas catching him, Andreas decided to out do himself this month. Thankfully the cpan-testers mailing list has been turned off for outbound, otherwise Andreas\' <strong>50683</strong> reports would have probably wiped out the servers at perl.org. In fact I suspect he may have only ramped up because the outbound mail was turned off. As a consequence the total number of reports submitted last month, far exceeded anything we\'ve seen before, topping <strong>150858</strong> reports! With Slaven Rezic, Imacat and Daniel Bosold also stepping up their testing, I\'m expected to see this level of report submissions to continue.</p>\r\n<p>Despite all the testing currently being performed, it is perhaps interesting to note that Perl 5.8.8, 5.10.0 and 5.11.0 are the 3 most tested versions of the perl interpreter. While these are likely to be the 3 versions of most interest to many developers, it would be good to keep the presence of earlier perls, especially 5.005, 5.6.1, 5.6.2 and a selection of 5.8.*. I know some of the testers are certainly trying to cover some of the traditional platforms, but if you have any machines that don\'t get regularly tested, and can spare the clock cycles, please see if getting involved in CPAN Testers is something that you could do.

Ask Bj&oslash;rn Hansen is already working on the central store, so this is a very welcome piece of the solution towards moving towards removing the email transport layer altogether. The final solution is still a while off yet, but things are moving, which is great. So thanks guys for taking the time out to work on the code.</p>\r\n<p>I recently attended the UKUUG 2008 Spring Conference, during which a discussion arose around CPAN Testers, and how other dynamic language repositories handle their testing. It would seem that Perl is head and shoulders above every other language repository, never mind dynamic languages. There were several developers of other languages that were truly amazed at the voluntary effort being put into ensuring CPAN is as well tested as possible. So a hearty pat on the back to all the CPAN Testers, you\'re setting a standard for others to aspire to. And to quote Mike Whitaker ... Perl is SO not dead :)</p>',NULL);

The outbound part of the mailing list has been a growing cause for concern for Ask and Robert, as with the increasing volume of reports, the mail server at perl.org has been suffering, and consequently all the other mailing lists, particularly all the Perl Monger group and Perl project mailing lists have been seeing severe delays. Reports should still be sent to the list, but all access and reference to them should be done through the NNTP server or the web based list. PAUSE Uploads can still be received via email thanks to the new cpan-uploads mailing list. This is read-only mailing list, and any mail sent to it will be ignored. Authors and Testers wishing to continue discussions for any particular reports should direct them to the cpan-testers-discuss mailing list.

Of course we would be delighted to see more of both ;) Over the past few months it\'s been interesting to see that all the top 5 testers are European based, and last month Serguei Trouchelle, who has been a tester for just under a year, has leapt into 5th place. Well done Serguei, and to all the testers for contributing their efforts.</p>\r\n<p>6 more addresses mappings, including 3 new testers. Even though there have been several new addresses spotted, and even some that have been around for a while, I think it\'s getting time again for my mail requesting clarification of who people are, so expect an email sometime this month if your email address isn\'t too obvious. Some are kind enough to include hints for me, but still the majority like to disguise their involvement.</p>\r\n<p>The Oslo Perl Mongers are organising the <a href=\"http://perl-qa.hexten.net/wiki/index.php/OsloQAWorkshop2008\">Oslo QA Hackathon</a> in April, followed by the Go Open Conference, where Adam Kennedy and Michael Schwern will be presenting. For various reasons it looks like a number of those involved with CPAN Testers won\'t be able to make the event, but there are plenty of TAP and standard Test tool authors going that it should be a good event to attend. I\'m planning to host a CPAN Testers BOF at both YAPC::NA and YAPC::Europe, with more of a mind to figure out some specifics for the future of CPAN Testers. In the meantime, the TAP and Test toolchain are likely to get a good round of tuits during the Hackathon, so hopefully we\'ll all see the benefits of the Hackathon.</p>',NULL);

I think Chris was after that accolade, but he\'ll just have to make do with being the highest test report submitter :) Thanks to the increased interest in bulk testing from our current top testers, we reach this point much sooner than I would have expected a few years ago. Thanks to these guys a large portion of CPAN has already been tested on 5.10, and we now have many reports across nearly all versions of Perl 5, certainly those known to be available in production environments.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://user.cs.tu-berlin.de/~eserte/\">Slaven Rezi&#263;</a>\'s <a href=\"http://bbbike.radzeit.de/~slaven/cpantestersmatrix.cgi\">CPAN Testers Matrix</a> is now accessible from each CPAN distribution page, as is David Cantrell\'s <a href=\"http://cpandeps.cantrell.org.uk/\">CPAN Dependencies</a> site, although with the expected increase in traffic, Dave is currently moving the site to a new box. Using the database generated for the stats site, <a href=\"http://hexten.net/\">Andy Armstrong</a> has created a <a href=\"http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/view/SmAgULsOtha6g7GcD5KnL2-\">slightly different presentation</a> of the success/failure graph that\'s on the stats site. I currently create all the graphs statically, which is fine when I\'m updating once a month. However, if I get the site updated more frequently, then it would be useful to enable you to click on the report you would like to see and create more professional looking graph/chart. I may well investigate more of manyeyes later.</p>\r\n<p>Interest in CPAN Testing is increasing, even if some authors still appear to be completely unaware of who and what CPAN Testers are. One thing for anyone confused by these reports, they are generated by computer, and are often unattended. As such instructions in the README file don\'t get read. If you have a prerequisite that is outside of the MakeMaker or Module::Build prerequisite framework, try and detect it using <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel::CheckLib\">Devel-CheckLib</a>. The <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/CPANAuthorNotes\">Notes For CPAN Authors</a> wiki page was specifically written for authors who need pointers to enable them to achieve a clean install. Although it should be noted, that while CPAN Testers aren\'t necessarily average users, they are trying to recreate environments that a brand new user would likely experience. The reports aren\'t there to harangue or berate you, they are trying to highlight problems that occurred during the build and testing processes. In some cases this may highlight problems in the automated test environment, which testers try very hard to resolve as soon as possible, but in the bigger picture we are making CPAN a more reliable and enviable code repository.</p>\r\n<p>17 more addresses mappings, including 8 new testers.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (27,27,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>More mappings with 13 new address mappings, including 6 new testers. Welcome to the new testers and hopefully we\'ll see even more in 2008. As we close out 2007, it\'s good to see that there has been a healthy interest in CPAN Testers. Even if it has been considered as an annoyance for some. There are now 61 different platforms being tested and 20 different versions of Perl. Regards the latter value the patch levels have been ignored in the stats, although you can still get at the raw data in the SQLite DB if you wish. The several of the major league testers have upgraded their environments to additional include Perl 5.10.0, which is now leading the test reports for the month. Not too surprising seeing the responsiveness of CPAN Testers these days.</p>\r\n<p>Taking a look at the tester submissions over the last month, it\'s impressive to see so many now regularly submitting several thousand a month. And we should not undervalued the efforts of those only submitting a few hundred a month, as only a few years ago they would have been topping the monthly stats. Although ActiveState have effectively stopped promoting Perl 5.6.1 on their page (it is still available though), the testing of the two latest releases on Windows has probably been the best it has been for some considerable time. The major operating systems on the whole seem well represented, although it would be nice to see some VMS, AIX, HP-UX or other less used, but still popular, operating systems in there.</p>\r\n<p>The number of badly formatted uploads and reports seem to be diminishing these days too, which has been good. We still get the odd one creeping through, but hopefully sometime during 2008 my alert script won\'t be compiling any emails for me :) One thing I do want to reiterate though, is that if you\'re going to get involved with CPAN Testing, please use an email address that people can contact you at. There are still a few who are using unreachable addresses and it makes it very difficult for authors to understand why something went wrong if you don\'t respond.</p>\r\n<p>The stats database has now been successfully ported to the website box, with nightly remote backups just in case anything goes wrong. The code changes seem to have improved matters considerable and the database updates now take just under an hour to complete. Considering the rise in reports, I\'m quite pleased with the improvements. Now to start looking at updating the website nightly :)</p>',NULL);

After our dramatic rise in testers over the last couple of months, unfortunately that number has dropped back again slightly this month. I would also like to thank, once again the testers who include their name or tag, that helps me to identify them. Many are new testers who aren\'t CPAN authors, so it makes my life a lot easier. Chris once again breaks his monthly record for most reports in a month with over 32,000 reports. After an early lead at the beginning of the month, I was hoping Andreas might finally take top spot for the month ... just to give Chris a bit of competition :) All the top ten testers have stepped up their testing this month, with all of them submitting over 1,000 reports, so a big thanks to them and all the CPAN Testers for taking the time to test and submitting their reports. 55 different perls got tested last month, which is the highest we\'ve ever had. Although it should be noted that the rise was mostly due to the different patch versions. I\'m considering folding those into the main release, as the CPAN Testers results site does this.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (29,29,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>After successfully mapping 54 addresses from September up to mid-October, I sent out the six-month request to all outstanding addresses used so far this year. After only a short time I\'d already received several emails from testers updating their details for me, mapping a further 14 addresses. It is notable that several new and current testers are now putting their names, or a least some form of reference in their addresses, that makes it very easy for my scripts to reference them, so thanks very much for that.</p>\r\n<p>One thing that does still irritate me though is testers who use an illegal, malformed or unreachable address. Aside from the stats, if as an author I receive a rather unusual test result and want to follow it up, who do I contact? \'root@dmz1\' or \'root@bender.domain\' is of no used whatsoever. If you\'re going to get involved with CPAN Testers, ** PLEASE ** use a legitimate and accessible email address so that authors can contact you if they need to.</p>\r\n<p>If you are a current tester and use email addresses like this, please change them so you can be contact by authors and not have communication end in a black hole. It has already been proposed that testers should register, somewhat more officially, that they wish to become testers, which the more I think about it, is probably the right way to go. We currently have a large number of testers regularly posting reports, even if some are only sending 2 or 3 a month. Those that send with badly configured test environments, we should be catching and encouraging to improve their setup if we can. Registering your interest might be a better way to enable that.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks to the efforts of our top 4 testers, my nightly scripts now take nearly 10 hours to run at the end of the month! The basic update takes roughly 2-3 hours and then the backend analysis and verification takes anything up to 8 hours to run at the moment. I\'m looking to improve these as I\'d like to be able to automate the publishing of the stats on a daily basis. The database is already published daily, so it shouldn\'t be too difficult. However, the verification process enables me to check that any uploads and reports haven\'t been missed or badly formatted, so that I can send the authors or testers emails to alert them to any problems. By improving the automation, I\'m hoping this can be done rather more quickly to raise the alerts earlier.</p>\r\n<p>In mid-October Andreas was looking to take over Chris\' monthly <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/mtesters.html\">top tester spot</a>, having submitted twice as many as Chris at the time. Since I happened to mention it to Chris when I saw him the other week, Chris has taken back his regular lead. Andreas has now taken up 3rd position on the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/testers.html\">leader board</a>, and making a good attempt to take 2nd place. Slaven Rezic is also making notable headway with his testing setup, to the point where he is now the 14th tester to have submitted over 10,000 reports, jumping from 24th to 10th place. Well done Slaven. The other notable mover is Nigel Horne who has moved from 11th to 9th. Several new testers have joined the crew, with both Matthew Musgrove  and Phil Monsen making a a very healthy debut, to the point we had 128 testers during October. Overall we have 600 known testers and 546 unmatched email addresses, making up 1146 listed testers at the moment, with only 10 unmatched email addresses for last month.</p>\r\n<p>One of the reasons for increased reports this month was due to the highest number of distribution uploads to CPAN in a single month, with over 1,500 packages being released. I have analysed how many of those are different versions of the same distribution, but maybe that\'s something I can add when I have a little more time.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to get involved in CPAN Testing, please checkout the <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers Wiki</a> for details of how to set things up.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (30,30,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>There was a dramatic change in reports <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/mreports.html\">last month</a>, with a significant increase in the number of FAIL and UNKNOWN reports. This is in part to a change in the way that some of the reports were being generated. It has been discussed on the <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/MailingLists\">CPAN Testers Discussion mailing list</a> and on the <a href=\"http://lists.cpan.org/showlist.cgi?name=perl-qa\">Perl QA mailing list</a>, as well as between the main developers of the tools, and several have been generated due to libraries being unavailable on the testing platform and a FAIL or UNKNOWN report being generated. These reports should have been treated as a missing prerequisite and not have been generated for the tested distribution. However, as the installer tool chain treats libraries and other Perl distributions differently, this makes it a little tricky to notify the automated testing tools that the reporting should be abandoned. Thankfully Andreas and David have quickly patched and released upgraded versions of <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN\">CPAN</a> and <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Reporter\">CPAN-Reporter</a>, so if you\'re using that side of the tool chain please upgrade now. <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPANPLUS\">CPANPLUS</a> already has a mechanism to detect library failures, so <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-YACSmoke\">YACSmoke</a> users should not being the same issue, however if you do, please let me know so I can investigate further. For further discussion and David Golden\'s clarification of the above, please see my use.perl <a href=\"http://use.perl.org/~barbie/journal/34591\">journal entry</a>.</p>\r\n<p>We broke several records for last month in the history of CPAN Testers. Aside from the highest FAIL and UNKNOWN reports being submitted, we also had the most PASS and NA reports in a single month, the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/mtesters.html\">most testers</a> in a single month, the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/mplatforms.html\">most platforms</a> tested in a single month, the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/mperls.html\">most perls</a> tested in a single month, the highest number of reports submitted from a single tester in a single month. But then we did also have the most <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/mreports.html\">UPLOADS</a> in a single month too, so it\'s perhaps not too surprising we\'ve seen some high numbers during September.</p>\r\n<p>This month also the first reports being submitted for 5.10, all 15 patch variants! It has made me wonder whether merging the patched versions into their main release version would be a good thing, to simplify the stats. I\'ll keep them as they are for now, but anyone has a strong opinion one way or the other, let me know.</p>\r\n<p>Currently in the CPAN Testers Statistics database there are 556 unaccounted tester addresses, with 1318 addresses mapped to 558 real testers. Only 1 new tester spotted this month, although I\'ve added 31 new address mappings. This is great in advance of my sixth month request for confirmation, as there are several addresses that just use \'root\' or similar, and it makes it difficult to know they are owned by. So hopefully when I get the chance to send the mails out, at least some of them will reply with more details. If you get a mail, please take the time to update me.</p>\r\n<p>Even though only 1 new tester was spotted, it is wonderful to see several previous testers, who have dropped off for one reason or another, submitting reports again last month. So much so that we had 120 testers submitting reports in September, the highest we\'ve ever had and the first time we\'ve had over 100 testers in a single month. However, it should be noted that ten only submitted 1 report ... but they all count :)</p>\r\n<p>Virtually all the top testers upped their game last month, with all but David Cantrell in the top 6 beating their previous month\'s number of submitted reports. Chris had another phenomenal month, submitting over 25,000 reports, such that his total in the leader board is a few reports under the combined submissions of his next 4 rivals. David made the leap from 4th to 2nd, while Andreas leapt from 7th to 5th, although I expect at the current rate Andreas will be in the 3rd place by the end of the year. Gabor and Slaven have also made notable jumps further up the standings and following their increased submissions after this month, I expect we\'ll be seeing them both in the top 20 shortly. The biggest jump this month is from Johannes Plunien, from 33rd to 22nd, who as mentioned last month only started testing in August. It just goes to show that you don\'t need to be a tester for long to make a worthwhile impact in CPAN Testing.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to get involved in CPAN Testing there is now a couple of established places to get help and advice. The definite resource for setting things up is the <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers Wiki</a>, with the <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/MailingLists\">CPAN Testers Discussion mailing list</a> your first point of call for advice or suggestions for improving the tools or resources.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (31,31,2,2,0,NULL,'<p>The heat is on for Chris Williams, he only thought Dave Cantrell was chasing his heels, but Andreas K&uuml;nig has also stepped up his game too. It has been a staggering month for the sheer volume of reports. In fact halfway through the month I did a quick check to see the current state of testing, and discovered that after only 15 days of testing in August, there nearly as many reports as there were for the whole of July! Andreas was less than 1000 reports behind Chris and Dave was less than 1500 behind Chris. However, Chris certainly rose to the challenge.</p>\r\n<p>The use of virtual machines and space on spare boxes by some of the testers has helped to give coverage to a lot of platforms that weren\'t seeing much exposure. In part this is one of the reasons I created the CPAN Testers Statistics site in the first place, so I\'m glad that worked. The Win32 platform has also been making a very significant return to form over the last 6 months as a regular testing platform, which extremely welcome. All the major platforms are well represented these days, even Irix. But more are always welcomed.</p>\r\n<p>Again over the last 6 months, there has been a dramatic increase in the range of perls getting tested, once again largely thanks largely to Chris, David and Andreas. while some testers use virtual environments, which is something that PITA will eventually be in a good position to take even further, it\'s also interesting to see failures where the default install of Perl is not the one being used for testing. It\'s highlighted some bad assumptions by authors and has helped to improve some of code on CPAN.</p>\r\n<p>Although there are a significant number of address still unmapped, I have managed to resolve 16 new tester address mappings and 7 new address mappings for known testers this month. However, there is a new challenger who has Chris, Dave and Andreas in his sights, and that\'s Johannes Plunien. Johannes only started testing last month and has already settled into 4th place for the monthly listings. It is great to see new testers getting involved.</p>\r\n<p>At this year\'s <a href=\"http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/\">YAPC::Europe</a> in Vienna, the <a href=\"http://vienna.yapceurope.org/ye2007/wiki?node=CPANTestersBOF\">CPAN Testers BOF</a> proved very fruitful, if only for a photo opportunity for <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/images/dscf9238.jpg\">Andreas, Chris and Dave</a>. There were a few additional thoughts discussed, including the change to the subject line of emails. This is something that David Golden recently suggested to Adam Foxson and myself, and although we all agree on the change, the details still need to be clarified. Also discussed was the move towards a non-email based method of fuelling CPAN Testers. Currently the email/nntp method is the primary announcement and report notification repository. However, Andreas has already been looking at an alternative method of announcing the recent uploads from PAUSE and providing a last week, last month, last quarter and last year list should not be too difficult to achieve.</p>\r\n<p>For sometime now there has been discussions about the method of reporting results. There has also been the concern from some authors that they may want to receive reports for particular distributions, for only FAIL reports, or not at all. The initial discussion centred around the use of the META.yml, which although might work, requires parsing being added to the all the tools. However, using a HTTP method of recording the results and then using the central server to send authors the email, it may be more appropriate to allow authors to register to the service (via PAUSE IDs) and alter their settings. At the moment most of this is still in the discussion stage, but it will be a major change to the way CPAN Testers currently works. We still expect the email mailing list, and thus the nntp group, to still exist, as they can be useful for general discussions regarding specific failure reports, but the aim will be to reduce the amount of mail that authors receive, which are not applicable or not wanted.</p>\r\n<p>After photographing <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/images/dscf9239.jpg\">Andreas, Chris, Dave and Lars Dieckow</a> before the BOF, I\'ve also thought about expanding the Stats Leader Board.

Well done to David and Ricardo.</p>\r\n<p>The biggest visual change that happen last month was the <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/32\">facelift given to several of the CPAN Testers websites</a>. The new look had been on the cards to do for quite sometime, but it wasn\'t a high priority, as functionality changes took most of my time. However, with some enforced CFT, I finally got a round tuit (although sadly not one of those wooden ones I see every so often at conferences :( ). Prompted by a post by Adam Kennedy, I spent some time after doing the biggest functionality to look at ways to improve the look and feel. I found a design that looked suitable, and began to adapt it for the look and feel that was released. Despite some disappointed comments, the majority of feedback as been very favourable.</p>\r\n<p>Part of the functionality changes include with the release of the new designs, was to now have a static site that reflects all the recent fixes to the underlying codebase, but without all the javascript extras available in the dynamic site. A number of people have been asking for a site that would enable them to switch from the old site, including some with issues with accessibility. As the old sites had not been updating since the end of March, the need for the static site grew. After a week bedding the new site in, the old URLs have now been moved to the new sites, so you will at least get redirected now. However, I would like to ask that if you have any reference to the old domains in code or documentation, or can update and wikis or online articles, please change to the new domains.

While we still have a little way to go for the 4 millionth report, it still marks an impressive milestone in the history of CPAN Testers. With just another 80,000 or so reports to go, we should reach the 4 millionth report sometime this month.</p>\r\n<p>On the CPAN Testers Discussion mailing list, I happened to point out that on every page of the new site design, across all the sites, the footer now includes a reference to the Perl programming language. David Golden has now done the same for the reports from CPAN-Reporter, but he <a href=\"http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/221/cpan-testers-supports-perl-programming/\">lamented that if only we\'d been doing this from the start</a>. Thankfully I have a solution for that, as another site I\'m planning on implementing is one to replace the NNTP web interface that is currently used. So that\'ll be 4 million web pages to add to the engines :)</p>\r\n<p>We topped 144 testers submitting reports last month, so thank you again to everyone involved. The mappings this month included 36 total addresses mapped, of which 22 were for newly identified testers.</p>',NULL);

David has identified some of the areas still to be worked on, so if you have some tuits to help out, it would be very much appreciated.</p>\r\n<p>The end of June also enjoyed the sun in Pittsburgh as part of YAPC::NA 2009, aka <a href=\"http://yapc10.org/yn2009/\">YAPC|10</a>. While there were some testing related talks, there wasn\'t a specific CPAN Testers talk this year, or BOF. So much has been going into the work of getting the websites upgraded I never got the time to prepare a talk about it all. Next year hopefully we\'ll have a lot more to say about Metabase and the CPAN Testers 2.0 infrastructure. The talk I did do in Pittsburgh, <a href=\"http://birmingham.pm.org/talks/barbie/stats-of-cpan/index.html\">The Statistics of CPAN</a>, did however highlight some very positive numbers about the state of CPAN. If nothing else it highlights that CPAN Testers has a lot of work to continue with for a long time to come. I\'m looking at putting a number of the tables and graphs into the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers Statistics website</a>, and if you have any suggestions for more, please let me know.</p>\r\n<p>Following the changes in the <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers Reports website</a>, the old domains now point to the static pages. Thanks to Ask, Robert and Jos for helping out with that. In doing so, a number of issues were pointed out that caused others problems. Specifically with the YAML files that are produced. Due to the vast number of reports now available, processing them is extremely time consuming. As a consequence to reduce the overhead, I ended up streamlining the data recorded in the YAML and JSON files, as several fields were either repeated or complete redundant. Unfortunately this has meant that some consumers of these files now are not able to process them correctly. As such there is now a new distribution on CPAN, <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Testers-WWW-Reports-Parser\">CPAN-Testers-WWW-Reports-Parser</a>, which can be used to correctly parse a CPAN Testers YAML or JSON file or data block, and return the fields you want. It supports all the fields previously used and knows how to construct them all from the current data set. If you plan on using the CPAN Testers data for a future project, please consider using this to ensure any future changes are instantly picked with a simple upgrade.</p>\r\n<p>Last month we had a total of 165 testers submitting reports. The mappings this month included 34 total addresses mapped, of which 17 were for newly identified testers.</p>\r\n<p>Congratulations to <strong>Dan Collins</strong>, who managed to post over 89,000 test reports in a single month, the highest we\'ve ever had. Unsurprisingly Chris wasn\'t too far behind :) I was also delighted to meet up with <strong>George Greer</strong> at YAPC|10, as for those that weren\'t aware, George took the honour of the 4 millionth post to the CPAN Testers mailing list at the end of May. A few days later, on June 7th, <strong>Serguei Trouchelle</strong> posted the 4 millionth accepted test report. Hopefully I\'ll get to meet Serguei at some point too. On average we have previously being seeing just over 200,000 reports posted each month, however, June saw 358,107 reports posted, a staggering amount of effort from all the testers.</p>\r\n<p>The next summary will hopefully be posted during <a href=\"http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/\">YAPC::Europe 2009</a> in Lisbon.

The change to the front page now allows you to see the current status of the builder, working away on the backend. The status update reports the number of requests in the queue and the request time of the oldest request. This should hopefully reduce the number of emails I get, asking whether the server is working, and whether its coping well with the volume of reports.</p>\r\n<p>At 19:10 on Saturday 25th July, the numbers looked like this:</p>\r\n<pre>+---------------------+-------+-------+<br />| oldest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | total | count |<br />+---------------------+-------+-------+<br />| 2009-07-23 14:01:39 | 11668 |&nbsp; 7900 | <br />+---------------------+-------+-------+<br /></pre>\r\n<p>From this you can see that the oldest request is just over 2 days old, there are a total of 11,668 requests waiting, of which 7,900 are unique.

If that happens then feel free to send me an email point it out.</p>\r\n<p>On the backend, some of the changes now ensure that the oldest requests are at least processed periodically, so that they don\'t stay in the queue too long.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (45,43,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>July has seen several major changes to the backend code to running the <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers Reports</a> website. The builder got some rules added to help manage the updates better and the front page now gets a status table. Tim Bunce suggested having some form of status indicator, and at the time some of the data needed to evaluate any indicators wasn\'t available. However, with some changes to the database, I was able to get the right information. As the site takes up to 5 days to get through all the changes, I had to wait a week before making the status table visible. At the moment the builder seems to have settled on running 2-3 days behind at most, and high profile pages often get built within a few minutes. The database now gets updated hourly, so there is now a much faster turn around of some of the pages. In addition to the status table, every author and distribution page now includes a timestamp of when the page was last built. If it\'s waiting in the queue to be rebuilt, at least you can now see how old the data available is. In many cases it will only be a few hours.</p>\r\n<p>There are currently 25k+ pages on the site (double if you include the static site), with roughly 6 files being generated for each request.

With so much data now available it\'ll become more important to figure that one out.</p>\r\n<p>Another change has been to the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers Statistics</a> website. For the last year or so, I\'ve been asked various questions about the data, and how different sets of criteria stack up. Some I already provide regarding the CPAN Testers, but there is also a lot of data regarding CPAN too. As such, there are now some extra pages included on the Statistics website, that give a current snapshop of the state of CPAN. I\'ve been meaning to provide these CPAN graphs for some time, and was a suggestion given to me after a London Perl Workshop, in 2007! If there are any other trend graphs or stats tables that you think might be useful or interesting, please let me know. I have another couple of tables I\'m planning to add, but I\'m always open to adding more :)</p>\r\n<p>This week I\'ll be at <a href=\"http://yapceurope2009.org\">YAPC::Europe 2009</a> in Lisbon. If you\'re a CPAN Tester and will be in Lisbon too, please come and say hello. I was disappointed to not meet a couple of people in Pittsburgh, though I did get to meet our 4 millionth poster to the cpan-testers mailing, <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/images/photos/yn2009-george-greer.jpg\">George Greer</a>.

There was a time I thought no-one could compete with Chris, but it seems he does indeed have a competitor. However, for anyone thinking that we have all scenarios covered, please take a look at the monthly test coverage. We are still looking for a variety of platforms, and indeed some of the older perls too. Unfortunately we don\'t know what is out there in the wild, and concentrating on the latest and greatest is not really a true representation of what companies are actually still using. So if you want to get involved with CPAN Testers, and don\'t have an unusual platform to test on (if you do, *please* get involved), you can still help out by ensuring that new CPAN releases still work on older version of perl. You might be surprised to learn that deployment is still happening on 5.003! While the author might not be willing to support older versions, many users still need that information.</p>\r\n<p>We\'re fast approaching the 5 millionth post to CPAN Testers, and expect to see it hit sometime during August month.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (47,45,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>This post is a bit of a celebration (you\'ll have to imagine the fireworks and associated oohs and ahhs), as last month we hit a few very notable milestones.</p>\r\n<h4>The 5 Millionth Post</h4>\r\n<p>Firstly, <em>Chris Williams</em> posted the <a href=\"http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/50000000\">5 millionth post</a> on 13th August.

Thankfully it has been coping rather well and while some page requests have been delayed by up to 3 days at times (it takes over 5 days to rebuild the site from scratch!), the number of pages outstanding has been very manageable.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (52,48,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Back in Jully, I reported that <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/38\">Killer Bots</a> were attacking the server with requests to the Reports site being overwhelming. As a result I implemented a crawler delay in the <em>robots.txt</em> file. This seemed to cure the main problem at the time, <em>Yahoo!

This morning they are still hitting the site far quicker than I want, but at least the site is now coping.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (53,49,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>In the <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/48\">last post</a> I mentioned that the server was getting hammered by robots. If the <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Reports</a> site was the only site served by the DB, this wouldn\'t be a problem, however in order to build the database and serve several sites, the DB gets quite a demand placed on it. I\'ve tweaked some of the configurations for the DB, such as increasing cache and reducing connection timeouts, but this is only eases the symptoms, and doesn\'t get to the heart of the problem.</p>\r\n<p>The problem is that of long running queries, particularly for some very complex queries. So this week, I\'ve been taking a look at some of those queries. In some cases I\'ve been able to take advantage of index and summary tables that are now used, thus reducing complexity, and re-evaluating processing to reduce calls too. This has meant changes to the Reports Summary AJAX script, The Uploads Generator and the Statistics Generator, all of which now take less time and have noticeably reduced their load on the server. We\'re still seeing lots of robot hits, but now they are not taking out the server.</p>\r\n<p>The biggest change has been to the code behind the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Statistics</a> website, by reducing processing time by as much as 20 minutes. It\'s been the first step to making it easier to produce statistics, and introduce new ones. While reworking the code to reduce DB load, I\'ve also introduced some new features to the site.</p>\r\n<p>The first new feature is the availability of the raw data that is used to generate the graphs. Last month Tim Bunce wanted to update his Perl Myths talk, but had to ask me to produce some fresh graphs for him, rather than be able to generate them himself as he wanted them. At his suggestion, I\'ve now made all the raw data files available as plain text (in CSV format) that produce all the graphs you see on the site. I\'m hoping to produce more graphs in the future, but I\'m also hoping that others may be able to use the raw data to produce other graphs that highlight different trends too.</p>\r\n<p>The second new feature is the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/perform.html\">Performance Graph</a>. This shows the number of requests the CPAN Testers Page Builder is processing and the number of reports being submitted each day. The \'requests\' is the total number of requests for a page rebuild that have been processed, and \'page\' indicates the number of unique requests that have been processed. A request is created when a report is submitted, a new distribution is uploaded or a website user requests a page on the dynamic Reports website, where a previous request exists. A page can either be a distribution page or an author page.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (49,45,3,2,0,NULL,'<h4>CPAN Testers is Ten Years Old</h4>\r\n<p>Thirdly, yes we hit another milestone last month, and perhaps the biggest cause for celebration. <strong>CPAN Testers has been running now for TEN YEARS!</strong> On August 28th 1999, at 7:08am Pacific Standard Time, the <a href=\"http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/1\">very first post</a> to the cpan-testers mailing was recorded, it was a CPAN Upload mail announcing Bundle-ABH had been released to CPAN. A few hours later, at 12:14pm Pacific Standard Time, the <a href=\"http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/6\">very first report</a> was posted to the mailing list by Paul Schinder, an UNKNOWN report for FCGI-0.48 running on a Solaris box under Perl 5.5.3.</p>\r\n<p>The idea of CPAN Testers was started by <em>Chris Nandor</em> and <em>Graham Barr</em> all those years ago, and has had many contributors to the eco-system since. Having said that notable mentions go to <em>Robert Spier</em>, <em>Ask Bj&oslash;rn Hansen</em>, <em>Andreas K&ouml;nig</em>, <em>Jos Bormans</em>, <em>L&eacute;on Brocard</em>, <em>Audrey Tang</em>, <em>Adam Foxson, David Golden</em>, <em>Chris Williams</em>, <em>David Cantrell</em>, <em>Slaven Rezi&#263;</em>, <em>Adam Kennedy</em> and I suppose it doesn\'t to hurt to mention myself (<em>Barbie</em>) too ;)</p>\r\n<p>My thanks to <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/testers.html\">all the CPAN Testers</a> who have contributed reports over the years, whether they have submitted several thousand or just the one, it has all helped.</p>\r\n<h4>YAPC::Europe 2009</h4>\r\n<p>At the beginning of last month several CPAN testers attended <a href=\"http://yapceurope2009.org\">YAPC::Europe</a> in Lisbon. We had a BOF and discussed ideas, and hopefully recruited some new testers to our humble community. One potential tester may have access to some very under tested platforms, so here\'s hoping we can add those to our regularly tested platforms each month.</p>\r\n<p>We also discussed statistics, following on from <a href=\"http://birmingham.pm.org/talks/barbie/stats-of-cpan-lt\">my lightning talk</a> about the state of CPAN. The talk had been previously given in Pittsburgh for <a href=\"http://yapc10.org\">YAPC::NA 2009</a>, but had largely been overlooked. It seems giving it as a lightning talk provided a much greater impact and left a much longer lastring impression for European attendees.</p>\r\n<p>Many of the statistics mentioned are now available on the <a href=\"http://static.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Statistics</a> site, and I\'m always happy to hear of more suggestions to include on there. The one overwhelm message taken from the talk is that CPAN contributions, both in terms of distributions and authors have been increasing consistently ever since CPAN was instigated back in 1995. New authors are signing up and contributing every month, and the existing contributors are not letting up either. Perl and CPAN have probably never been healthier. Which all goes to show just how important CPAN testers can be in helping authors maintain good quality and reliable code for the benefit of all.</p>\r\n<h4>Promoting CPAN Testers</h4>\r\n<p>It was an incredible month last month for CPAN Testers, with all the potential for announcements. Sadly, I was without an internet connection last week to be able to make announcements for the last two events at the time, as it would have been nice to have spread a bit of good karma around to everyone who has been involved.</p>\r\n<p>Which raises a point about CPAN Testers that I have been asked several times over the last year. Why don\'t we shout out more about CPAN Testers, as according to some, it is one of the Perl Community\'s successful community projects. Sadly I\'m only one person, and I don\'t shout very loud. I used to give talks about becoming a CPAN Testers regularly at YAPCs in North America and Europe, but these days look more to the BOF sessions to encourage interest. <em>Chris Williams </em>has started to continue the CPAN Tester howto style talks in Europe, but we could do with others around the world.</p>\r\n<p>So if you\'re thinking of what talk to do at a forthcoming YAPC, OSDC, Workshop or local technical meeting, or even at a technical conference, workshop or local user group meeting that isn\'t focused on Perl, please consider whether you could help promote CPAN Testers. I\'ll gladly feature links to you, your slides and the event in a dedicated post on the <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Blog</a> to help out. Likewise if you have written an article for a printed or online magazine or even in your own blog, please let me know and I\'ll mention it in a future post.</p>\r\n<h4>And Finally</h4>\r\n<p>Last month we had a total of 166 testers submitting reports. The mappings this month included 23 total addresses mapped, of which 13 were for newly identified testers.</p>\r\n<p>Once again many thanks to all the several thousand CPAN Testers who have contributed reports, and here\'s to the next ten years :)</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (54,50,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Over the last week and weekend, I took a fresh look at the matrices on the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Statistics</a> site, following some suggestions from tester MW487, The matrices as they previous stood, didn\'t really reveal that much. Plus as the active cells were so spread out, reading each matrix was awkward.</p>\r\n<p>Firstly the numbers for Reports and Distributions were merged into the same cells, thus making it easier to see the corrolation between the number of reports submitted and the number of distributions being tested. In addition the split between the matrices is now based on general OS name and the platform reference in the perl -V block. The reasons for this are twofold; firstly it makes it a little more obvious where testing is lacking, and thus where new testers might want to concentrate their efforts, and secondly for users to highlight Operating Systems and platforms where testing is well supported.</p>\r\n<p>The next step was to provide matrices that covered only officially released perls, as well as all released perls, followed by matrices that highlighted testing within the last month, as well as the whole of CPAN testing. Lastly I\'ve brought back the colour coding, or fading, to further highlight testing strengths and weaknesses.</p>\r\n<p>There a now further plans to expand the matrices, but these are the first major changes. Expect more work on the statistics in the coming months.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (55,51,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Following on from the previous updates, further work has been done on the matrices. The old matrices suffered from seeing mostly a blank table when you opened the page, which isn\'t really too inviting when you first load a page, and can also give the wrong impression. As such both X &amp; Y axes now include totals, with the Y axis being sorted in descending total order, and the X axis being sorted in order of Perl version. Now each matrix loads with a bit of colour immediately, rather than having to seach for it. An example is the matrix for <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/osmatrix-month.html\">OS, official Perls for last month</a>, highlighting that Linux really is extremely well tested on more recent versions of Perl.</p>\r\n<p>A further change to the matrices is to provide a widescreen version. Essentially this is for those who have asked to see the full table and print it, without the header and menu navigation layout. Again an example is the matrix for <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/pmatrix-full-wide.html\">Platforms, all Perls and all reports</a>, which one of the larger tables and would otherwise require a lot of scrolling to see the full table.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, for this update, a new table has also been introduced for the Monthly statistics, that of <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/mosname.html\">Operating Systems</a>. Although the OS matrices show the full picture and a snapshot for the previous full month, it doesn\'t show how the data has changed each month. This new table highlights better the monthly volumes of reports for each Operating System, and also focuses attention on Opearting Systems which could use a little more attention.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://birmingham.pm.org/tech/207\">October Technical Meeting</a> for <a href=\"http://birmingham.pm.org\">Birmingham Perl Mongers</a> include a presentation of the new changes, and opened up a discusssion for what other features and statistics could be included in the future. My thanks to JJ and Colin for their ideas and thoughts, as they provided some great suggestions which I shall be working on over the coming weeks. As such, expect even more updates soon :)</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (56,52,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>With thanks to Jon \'JJ\' Allen for the suggestion, CPAN Testers now has a new dashboard on the front page of the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Statistics</a> site.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It\'s often been asked whether there is a counter of some kind that counts the number of CPAN uploads, thus providing a way to instantly the see the number of distributions on CPAN. As that counter doesn\'t change very often, I thought including the number of test reports submitted might be a little more dynamic, so you now you get both.</p>\r\n<p>To add a bit of colour, you also get a few selected graphs, hopefully creating a nice snapshot of the current state of CPAN and CPAN Testers.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (57,53,2,2,0,NULL,'<p>With the recent updates to the matrices, there is one new addition that I forgot to mention.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (59,54,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>If you\'ve not been following the <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers</a> in the last month, you will likely have missed the updates to the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Statistics</a> site. I would like to thanks <strong>MW487</strong>, <strong>JJ</strong> and <strong>Colin Newell</strong> for their thoughts and suggestions. The biggest changes have been around the matrices. The old matrices have been thrown away and a completely new set have been created, merging much of the data that was previously across the two old style matrices. The site now also looks at the OS system, rather than the specific version installed, which now gives a better general overview. In turn a new <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/mosname.html\">OS table</a> is also available highlighting the number of tests per month are attributed to a particular OS. Unsurprisingly Linux is currently streets ahead of any other OS.</p>\r\n<p>The graphs have always been of interest to those wishing to use them to promote Perl and CPAN, however, the way they are currently presented, doesn\'t always suit everyone, especially if they wish to change the style or take a different snapshot of the data. As such, you can now download the raw data files used to generate the graphs. All the files are in CSV format, so are easily loaded into you spreadsheet application of choice. Speaking of spreadsheets, in addition to changing the look of the matrices, you can now also download an XLS version of each matrix, as well as now having the ability to view each table in a widescreen format.</p>\r\n<p>A new graph available is the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/perform.html\">Performance Graph</a>, which shows how the CPAN Testers Reports Page Builder is performing each day, against the volume of reports submitted per day. While the majority of the time the Builder does perform well, every so often it slows due to the load on the web server, meaning it has to occasionally catch up, which can take several days. Now you can see whether any issues have caused your page to take a little longer to build, as well get a better idea of how many reports are getting submitted every day.</p>\r\n<p>The most recent update has been the new dashboard on the homepage. Every so often I get asked how many CPAN distributions are on CPAN. Although the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/statscpan.html\">CPAN Statistics</a> have had their own page for a while now, some have mentioned that it would be really cool to have a ticker that flips as a new upload gets added to CPAN. Although I can\'t do that just yet in true realtime, the new dashboard does try an emulate the rate at which reports and uploads have been submitted over the previous 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>In other CPAN related news the proposals and discussions for <a href=\"http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/519/list-of-cpan-meta-spec-proposals/\">Meta-Spec 2.0</a> have now come to a close. David Golden is currently <a href=\"http://github.com/dagolden/cpan-meta-spec\">accepting patches</a> to the approved proposals and hopefully we\'ll have a new draft specification available soon. It\'s been an interesting discussion in some cases, while others have been agreed or rejected almost without question. Some require a bit more thought, so it\'s likely there will be a further refinement of the spec in the future. If you want to read all the threads, visit the <a href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/cpan-workers@perl.org/index.html#00197\">mailing list archives</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Last month we had a total of 171 tester addresses submitting reports.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (60,55,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Several months ago, <strong>Dave Cantrell</strong> noticed he wasn\'t receiving the Daily Summaries for some of his distributions that had received FAIL reports, and were shown on his Reports page. This began a series of code fixes and debugging that never seemed to resolve the issue.</p>\r\n<p>With the recent changes to the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Statistics</a> site, to reduce SQL calls and generally improve processing, I began the same with the <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Testers-WWW-Reports-Mailer\">Daily Summary code</a>. Having added some additional logging information and reorganising the SQL queries, the problem Dave highlighted became clear. One of the SQL queries wasn\'t returning exactly what I expected, at least not all the time. In most cases it would, but you had to catch it just right to see what was happening. As a result the bug is now fixed, and Daily Summaries are flowing properly again.</p>\r\n<p>The recent clean up has also highlighted another problem, that is outside of the scope of anything CPAN Testers specific, and resides with authors themselves. It amazes me how many authors give false or invalid addresses, or change their address and forget to update their PAUSE account. Is it any wonder that some have trouble trying to contact authors. At some point, using the <a href=\"https://prefs.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Preferences</a> system, I plan to start publishing a list of PAUSE IDs that fail to respond. Those with full boxes won\'t be included, but will specifically highlight IDs that return invalid address error messages.</p>\r\n<p>I see this as being a useful resource to remind authors that their PAUSE account may need updating, and also for anyone wishing to contact an author, whether there is any likelihood of them actually receiving a useful response. There are currently 7744 PAUSE accounts (at the time of writing), and although the number returning errors is quite small, it\'s enough to be annoying for those trying to contact those particular authors.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (61,56,2,2,0,NULL,'<p>Back in 2008, it was obvious that the fragmentation of CPAN Testers sites was a problem. The system was slow, usually getting updated just once a day, and the presentation was a little disjointed. At that point a dedicated server was suggested, as this would bring a number of the key sites together and potentially provide a base with which to improve the updates of the sites. In addition it was seen a first step towards <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/Roadmap\">CPAN Testers 2.0</a>.</p>\r\n<p>In late September 2008 a proposal was put forward to the members of <a href=\"http://birmingham.pm.org\">Birmingham Perl Mongers</a>, to donate funds to aquiring a dedicate server to host a range of sites and databases. Unanimously they approved the proposal and a server was paid for at <a href=\"http://www.hetzner.de\">Hetzner Online AG</a>. Based in Germany on a high bandwidth line, the server has enabled CPAN Testers to grow and now supports a dynamic set of sites and databases that are a consistent benefit to authors and users.</p>\r\n<p>The server was covered for 1 year, with the intention of looking for a corporate sponsor to continue the funding for further years. However, due to the recent economic climate, the opportunities for funding appear to be limited. As such, recently another proposal was put to the members of Birmingham Perl Mongers, and once again they unanimously approved it. The server and hosting is now paid up for another year, and plans are afoot to further increase the family of sites and provide more resources to authors, testers and users.</p>\r\n<p>Many thanks to all of <a href=\"http://birmingham.pm.org\">Birmingham Perl Mongers</a> for their continued support of the CPAN Testers project.</p>',NULL);

So expect a 10 million reports post some time in August 2010 :)</p>\r\n<p>Now that we are producing so many reports, while there is a desire to get more reports from less tested operating systems, Tim Bunce recently highlighted his interest in getting reports that included a diverse set of Perl configuration flags, in particular regarding how Perl was compiled (with and without threads, etc). At the moment the CPAN Testers Statistics database doesn\'t include that information, but the Metabase that is behind CPAN Testers 2.0 will. In addition the Metabase will be able to be queried to glean the reports that contain a specific set of flags, etc. At the moment there are quite a few different setups testing on the top few operating systems being tested. While some authors see these as just repeated results, in some cases they provide slight differences in the test results.

From there it will also be integrated into the new site that is hopefully being launched early next year, which will allow testers to register their testing addresses (among other things).

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (70,64,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Last month CPAN Testers was finally <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/61\">given a deadline</a> to complete the move away from SMTP to HTTP submissions for reports. Or perhaps more accurately to move away from the perl.org servers, as the amount of report submissions has been affecting support of other services to the Perl eco-system. The deadline is <strong>1st March 2010</strong>, which leaves just under 2 months for us to move to the CPAN Testers 2.0 infrastructure. Not very long.</p>\r\n<p><strong>David Golden</strong> has now put together a <a href=\"http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/614/project-plan-for-cpan-testers-2-0-migration/\">plan of action</a>, which is being rapidly consumed and worked on. The first fruits of which has been an update to the <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Reports</a> site. The ID previously visible on the site, refering to a specific report, is now being hidden away. The reason for this is that the current ID refers to the NNTP ID that is used on the perl.org NNTP archive for the <em>cpan-testers</em> mailing list. This ID is specific to the SMTP submissions and includes many posts which are not valid reports. As such we will be moving to a GUID as supplied by the Metabase framework, with existing valid SMTP submitted reports being imported into the Metabase. The NNTP ID will eventually be completely replaced by the Metabase GUID across all parts of the CPAN Testers eco-system, including all the databases and websites. As such you will start to see a transition over the next few weeks.</p>\r\n<p>The second change which has now been implemented, is to present the reports via the <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Report</a> site and not the NNTP arcive on the perl.org servers. Currently the presentation of a report (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/6524841\">this report for App-Maisha</a>) is accessed via the reports pages for a distribution or an author, but will also be accessible in a similar manner across all the CPAN Testers websites. There are a large batch of early reports that are currently missing from the database, but these are being updated now, and will hopefully be complete within the next few days. If you have any issues with the way the reports are presented, including any broken or missing links from other parts of the site, please let me know.</p>\r\n<p>In all this change, there is one aspect that may worry a few people, and that is the <em>&quot;Find A Tester&quot;</em> application. For the next few months it will still exist, but the plan is to make the Reports site more able to provide tester contact information. In addition to this the testers themselves will soon have the ability to update their own profiles. Initially this will be used to link email addresses to reports and then map those email addresses to a profile held wihtin the Metabase, but in the longer term will be used to help us manage the report submissions better.</p>\r\n<p>David Golden is concentrating on the Client and Metabase parts of the action plan, and I am working on porting the websites and \'cpanstats\' database. If you have any free time and would like to help out, please review the <a href=\"http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/614/project-plan-for-cpan-testers-2-0-migration/\">action plan</a>, join the <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/MailingLists\"><em>cpan-testers-discuss</em> mailing list</a>, and please let us know where you\'d like to help. There is a lot of work to be done and the more people involved, the better the spread of knowledge in the longer term.</p>\r\n<p>After David announced the <a href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/cpan-testers-discuss@perl.org/msg01550.html\">deadline last month</a>, all the testers have throttled back their smoke bots. This saw a dramatic reduction in the number of reports and page being processed, and enabled the Reports Page Builder to catchup with itself, to the point it was frequently having less than a 1000 request waiting. That changed yesterday with the changes to the website, as every page now needs to be updated. It typically takes about 5 days to build the complete site, so this quiet period will help allow the Builder to rebuild the site, without adversely affecting the currently level of report submissions. Expect the site to reach a more managable level of processing some time next week. To help monitor the progress of the builder, a new part of the Reports site, <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org/home/status\">The Status Page</a>, now checks the status of all outstanding request every 15 minutes, providing a 24 hour persepctive and a week long perspective.</p>\r\n<p>A new addition to the family was also launched recently, the <a href=\"http://analysis.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Analysis</a> site, which <strong>Andreas K&ouml;nig</strong> has been working on, to help authors identify failure trends from reports for their distributions.

The mappings this month included 22 total addresses mapped, of which 2 were for newly identified testers. Another low mapping month, due to work being done on CPAN Testers as a whole.</p>\r\n<p>My thanks this month go to <strong>David Golden</strong> for finding the time to write an action plan, and <strong>his wife</strong> for allowing him the time to write it, as well as working on all the other areas involving the CPAN Testers and the Metabase :)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',NULL);

As a consequence measures are now being put in place to completely ban the msnbot from accessing at least the Reports site, and probably all the sites on the server.</p>\r\n<p>Microsoft in their incompetent wisdom decided to unleash 20-30 bots every few seconds.

Most sensible bots, such as those of Google or Majestic 12, will only let one bot at a time crawl a site, as most sensible companies acknowledge that a DOS attack is not good policy.

Instead I\'m locking the doors, and no longer letting you through.</p>\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Microsoft added a whole bunch of IP addresses to those previously listed, to the point I\'ve now had to block any 65.55.*.* address. The others are now getting 403s so maybe eventually they might get the message, though they haven\'t stopped yet!</p>',NULL);

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (74,68,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>One month to go and work is progressing well on the transformation to <em><strong>CPAN Testers 2.0</strong></em>. Over the last month many changes to the websites have been visible, but just as many changes have been happening behind the scenes. The Metabase is a key part of the transformation, and although work has been going well, it is reaching the point where it\'ll need some serious testing prior to switch over on <strong>1st march 2010</strong>. If you have the time, please join the <em>cpan-testers-discuss</em> mailing list or contact <em>David Golden</em> to let him know what you can help with. See David\'s <a href=\"http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/647/cpan-testers-2-0-mid-january-update/\">CPAN Testers 2.0 mid-January update</a> blog post for a more detailed status update.</p>\r\n<p>In order to reduce the load on the perl.org servers, after the announcement of the switch over, the CPAN Testers agreed to back off their smokers to ease the pressure on the perl.org mail servers. The <em>cpan-testers</em> mailing list is a very high volume list, and takes up a lot of resources to manage it. Many of the testers throttled back their smoke bots and we did see a dramatic reduction in test reports being submitted. We were aiming for around 5,000 a day maximum. Within a day or two we were successfully below the target.</p>\r\n<p>However, not all went well. One smoker bot suddenly appeared to go AWOL, and the tester didn\'t seem to be responding to direct requests to throttle the smoker. Worse still the bulk of reports being produced were bogus. While some PASS reports got through, most were failing due to what appears to be a bad combination of environment and old toolchain software. As this was now polluting the pool of reports at a considerable rate (for every good report submitted, 1 or more was submitted by the bad smoker), something needed to be done to reduce or halt the effects. Several authors were rightly concerned that this would make their distributions look bad on the <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Reports</a> site. Thankfully, a new site (more on the later) is in the works which will make this easier to manage, but in the interim a further measure was put in place. I now have the ability to blacklist runaway smokers, by invalidating their reports as the come in. This then means the reports are ignored by the Reports site, the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org\">Statistics</a> site and the rest of the eco-system. I also manually marked all the smoker\'s reports during January as invalid.</p>\r\n<p>It transpires that the tester was on holiday and had started off his smokers before he went, without checking to ensure the reports they were sending were valid. Once this tester has upgraded to use the right tools, I\'ll remove him from the blacklist. However, it is good to know that we can now quickly stop any future runaway smokers before they can do much damage to the reports and statistics.</p>\r\n<p>Normally one story would be the only excitement of a month, but there was more to come. On 17th January, the CPAN Testers server started show effects of being under attack. In the early hours of 18th January, the server locked up, and required manual intervention to reboot it. Once back online, an investigation through the logs revealled that the MSNBot, as used by Microsoft, had been hitting the server at a rate of knots. In fact, so much so, that the logs began rapidly filling up again after the reboot. After initially blocking the range of IPs, which grew as the day went, I wrote an article and posted to the <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/65\">CPAN</a> <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/cpan_testers/2010/01/msnbot-must-die.html\">Testers</a> blogs to warn anyone who might be using the CPAN Testers server. Little did I realise that the story would spread like wildfire around the world on numerous IT related news networks and blogs! I did get an apology from someone representing the Bing team, but it should never have got to that. Reading many of the comments on various blogs, although a small minority took delight in having a kick at Perl, the majority of posts were in support of the ban, and many even had their own experiences. While I may have been the first to shout loudly, CPAN Testers definitely weren\'t the first to be knocked out by Microsoft.</p>\r\n<p>Over a week later, with the ban still in place, and the robots.txt changed to ban all access to msnbot, every hour now the msnbot blasts the server for about 5-10 minutes at the rate of between 4-8 requests a second, mostly from the same 2 IP addresses. So even after banning the bot (it gets a 403) and having an apology from Microsoft, the bot still hasn\'t learnt to get itself under control. If Microsoft ever want people to take Bing seriously as a search engine, then they need to start acting responsibly, otherwise they are likely to find themselves banned from a good portion of the internet.</p>\r\n<p>One thing I would like to make clear about the incident, is that all the monitoring of the server is done completely voluntarily. Over the last month this has taken up a lot of spare time, which often wasn\'t there to begin with. However, the server itself is *NOT* a High-Availability setup, and is *ONE* server on its own. No redundancy (apart from the RAIDed disks) with the web server, database and processing tools all sharing the same physical hardware. If it takes 2 seconds to return a web page, its likely that the server is under considerable load to process incoming reports, running backups or generating web pages, RSS feeds, JSON/YAML files to keep the rest of the eco-system (including CPAN/CPANPLUS, search.cpan.org, etc) able to keep up to date. Taking it out of action is not something that is taken lightly.</p>\r\n<p>The original post was perhaps rather emotionally put together, and I apologise to anyone who may have got caught in any flak for that. However, I had just woken up and spent much of the morning trying to get the server back online while getting the kids ready for school and heading out to work! With it being a Monday morning too, hopefully it was understandable that a rant ensued. I\'ll be taking several deep breaths, if (though hopefully not) it happens again!</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier in the post, and in the previous summary, I did plan to release a new site during January. The CPAN Testers Administration site is still planned to go live, just not yet. With all the changes to the underlying software for CT2.0, there are some changes required for the Administration site that also need to be done. As this isn\'t live yet, I now consider it a low priority to getting CT2.0 completed, and will now wait until after CT2.0 has gone live, before finishing off the release.</p>\r\n<p>In the last weekend of January, the biggest changes to the current databases went into effect, with the Metabase GUID now being used. Although the full extent of the change won\'t be seen until we\'re using the Metabase for submitting reports, this first shift is an important one. There were a few glitches as I brought the processing tools back online, as I soon discovered little parts that were affected by the change that I hadn\'t anticipated. Thankfully the errors were minor and all were quickly fixed. The server is now catching up on processing from the weekend, and I anticipate all will be back to normal service within the next day or two.</p>\r\n<p>To reduce the processing load, <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/67\">as mentioned in a previous post</a>, the database backups are now happening a little less frequently. The CVS backups have now been disabled, with the uploads and release databases both backed up once a day (usually between 00:30 and 02:30 Central European Time). The cpanstats database is currently backed up once an hour, but seeing as the bzip version seems to be only popular with a few people (one being Yahoo! Slurp :)) and only downloaded at most once a day by any single IP (including Yahoo! Slurp ... see Microsoft, some search engines can get it right), I\'m considering only generating the bzip version only once a day. I\'ll watch the logs and see if there are any changes, but if aren\'t I will likely adjust the backups inline with current requests for the files.</p>\r\n<p>Along with the backup changes, various other daily server processes have been reviewed and many have been rescheduled to reduce server load. The end result has been to reduce the nightly overheads and hopefully the server will be in a better position to process reports once the CPAN Testers switch to the Metabase and unleash their smokers from the current limiters.</p>\r\n<p>Last month we had a total of 162 tester addresses submitting reports. The mappings this month included 21 total addresses mapped, of which 7 were for newly identified testers. Another low mapping month, due to work being done on CPAN Testers as a whole.</p>\r\n<p>A long summary this month, but then a lot has been happening. Expect updates throughout the month as various parts of CT2.0 undergo testing, and we start to see the results of all the hard work of the past couple of years. The future is nigh.</p>',NULL);

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (76,70,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>You might recall we made <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/61\">an announcement</a> a few months ago, regarding a deadline. The deadline, <em>1st March 2010</em>, was the date we had to switch from SMTP to HTTP for report submissions. Since December there has been a lot of work behind the scenes, and some public changes too. Much of the publicly visible work has been done that can be done, while the remaining backend pieces are completed. <a href=\"http://www.dagolden.com/\">David Golden</a> has been <a href=\"http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/682/cpan-testers-2-0-mid-february-update/\">posting</a> regarding his <a href=\"http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/685/cpan-testers-2-0-interim-milestone/\">progress</a> on the Metabase, which will stand as a core component of CPAN Testers in the future.</p>\r\n<p>David has made a lot of progress in the last few months, taking the Metabase, which was essentially still in the design phase, through to development and is very near deployment. So near in fact that within the next week he hopes to have a few high profile testers using it. While the CPAN Testers Statistics database won\'t be able to read the reports just yet, they will not be lost. Any reports submitted to the new HTTP gateway will all be mass consumed when all the kinks have finally been ironed out and the report parser is eventually pointed at the Metabase.</p>\r\n<p>So what of the deadline? Well, although we had high hopes to achieve it, we missed it. As CPAN Testers is a completely volunteer effort our time to write and test the new code, has been governed by our free time. However, <a href=\"http://log.perl.org/\">Robert and Ask</a> have been extremely supportive of us, and having seen the results so far, are willing to keep the SMTP gateway open for a little while longer. That being said, it does require that all current CPAN Testers keep their smokebots throttled so we are not overwhelming the server. With the decrease in submissions over the last few months, Robert and Ask have been able to better manage the server, and we would like to keep it that way. With the headway that we are making, it hopefully won\'t be too long before we do move over to the HTTP gateway and the Metabase.</p>\r\n<p>With so much concentration on the move to CT2.0, we unfortunately have very little else to report as yet. Although there is the <a href=\"http://2010.qa-hackathon.org\">QA Hackathon</a> in Vienna to look forward to. Hopefully by then we\'ll be able to review the state of play with the CPAN Testers and make any refinements needed, as well as look at any feature enhancements that people might find useful.</p>\r\n<p>One aside to the CT 2.0 work, has been for me to take a look at some of the distributions listed on the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Statistics</a> site, <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/wdists.html\">Failure Counts</a> and <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/wpcent.html\">Failure Percentage</a> tables. Taking some of the distributions in hand, I\'ve been able to submit patches for a few, which included a significant overhaul for one (its currently with the author, who was delighted to have me work on the distribution). If you or your Perl Monger group are interested in learning about writing tests, I can only suggest you take a look at some of the distributions in those tables and see whether you can help fix them. In the vast majority of cases the authors will be very grateful to you for helping them, and you\'ll also be helping to contribute to the Perl community. I\'m looking at adding some more tables to list those distributions submitted in the last 6 months, and possibly in the last month, to hopefully highlight quicker distributions that may appreciate a bit of help.</p>\r\n<p>Last month we had a total of&nbsp; 149 tester addresses submitting reports.

Currently it\'s still considered Beta, but initial problems appear to have been worked out, and the Metabase is receiving reports thick and fast. So much so that some testers started to ramp up their smoker bots again, forgetting that some were still submitting SMTP reports.

As a consequence some of the tools used with the CPAN Testers website may not have appeared to be correct. Currently the IDs used to display reports are specific to the cpanstats database, and no longer match the NNTP ID. The GUID which is used by the Metabase can be used, and this can be generated from a NNTP ID using David Golden\'s <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Testers-Common-Utils\">CPAN-Testers-Common-Utils</a> distribution.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (79,73,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Over the weekend of the <a href=\"http://2010.qa-hackathon.org\">QA Hackathon</a>, which by all accounts was another great success (and I think David, Ricardo aand I all wish we could have been there too), various work on CPAN Testers 2.0 was underway. With the submission to the Metabase and the feed from the Metabase into the cpanstats database being two very distinct parts of the eco-system, it has made work on both parts a lot easier as it only requires one interface between them. While much of the interface has been evolving, it has for the most part been fairly straightforward. However, unfortunately while testing the interface, I noticed that several reports had been posted with no text report. Seeing as this is the part that authors really need to see, it means that we now have to discard those reports. In addition, David also found a problem with how S3 names objects, which was causing a problem for storing facts within the Metabase.</p>\r\n<p>With these problems surfacing, the decision was made to restart the Metabase with a completely new instance. <a href=\"http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/754/cpan-testers-2-0-beta-reset/\">This is now Beta2</a> :) The previously submitted reports are not lost, but will be evaluated and valid reports will be inserted into the new instance once we have a little more time.<a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org\"><br /></a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org\">The Reports website</a> has now been upgraded, both to the latest version of Labyrinth (with more performance improvements), and with full CPAN Testers 2.0 support. As we will shortly be moving to the Metabase as the primary feed for reports, in order to ensure that the Metabase is fully supported, all the links on the website will now start to reference the GUID rather than the cpanstats id or the old NNTP id. What this means is that all the YAML, RSS and JSON files all now use the GUID as a primary key. The \'id\' field that currently exists will remain and contains the cpanstats id. If you have tools that use the \'id\' you should not need to make any changes, but you may wish to think about using the GUID for display or link purposes in the future. The YAML, RSS and JSON files that currently exist are being updated as reports come in and the respective pages are rebuilt.</p>\r\n<p>The Daily Summary, and associated reports that are mailed out, are currently being updated to reference the GUID. This should be rolled out later this week. After that everything should be in place to roll out the Metabase feed once the Beta testing is complete. All being well this should be really soon now ;)</p>',NULL);

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (82,76,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Back In January, I <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/65\">reported</a> how Microsoft had launched what amounted to a denial of service attack on the CPAN Testers server. It seems that 4 months later, we have yet again been targeted for attack from Microsoft. After the last attack, any IP address matching \'65.55.*.*\', hitting the main CPAN Testers website, was blocked (returning a 403 code). Every few weeks I check to see whether Microsoft have actually learnt and calmed down their attack on the server. So far, disappointingly, despite an alleged Microsoft developer saying they would look into it, the attack on the server has continue with little alteration to their frequency and numbers. Had they changed and been considerably less aggressive I would have lifted the ban.</p>\r\n<p>Yesterday, Microsoft launch a further attack on the server using a complete new set of IP addresses. Now, just to clarify, this wasn\'t just a complete new set of IP addresses, but a completely new set PLUS the original set, thus effective doubling the attack on the server. Now you could claim stupidity or ignorance on behalf of the msnbot/Bing developers, but after being warned last time, and receiving 403s from their existing bots, by adding in a whole new set of IPs, I consider this latest attack nothing short of malicious.</p>\r\n<p>These new IP address have now been added to the blocklist, and I\'m now writing a script to alert me should any new IP address from Microsoft be added to their attack formation. Thankfully, I happened to be on the server at the time as both attacks hit, and managed to catch the IPs before they took out the server completely.</p>\r\n<p>With my last post about this, I was accused of doing a disservice to Perl. Had I not been furious at the time, and written about the incident, I wouldn\'t have learnt that this was a Microsoft tactic that had infuriate a lot of people, and discovered that I wasn\'t the only sysadmin or website administrator around the world that had chosen to block Microsoft from their websites and servers. If Microsoft think thuggery is the way to improve their search content, then they are very sadly mistaken.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Update: </strong> Microsoft have now been in touch, and again apologised. We\'ll have to wait and see whether this can be resolved.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (83,77,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Over the weekend, I put together the evidence for the Microsoft Bing team, to help them understand why their bots are hitting the site so aggressively. In addition I put several questions to them as to how their bot clusters work, and why they don\'t follow some very simple rules.</p>\r\n<p>To give you an understanding of the problem, the following are some basic stats gleaned from the logs, for those requests identifying themselves as \'msnbot\'.</p>\r\n<pre>First: 09/May/2010:02:26:22 +0200<br /></pre>\r\n<pre>Last:  15/May/2010:01:21:42 +0200<br /></pre>\r\n<pre>Total Hits:      82130<br /></pre>\r\n<pre>Total Requests:  79999<br /></pre>\r\n<pre>Total IPs:       161<br /></pre>\r\n<pre>Status Code 200: 8473<br /></pre>\r\n<pre>Status Code 301: 83<br /></pre>\r\n<pre>Status Code 403: 73572<br /></pre>\r\n<pre>Status Code 500: 2<br /></pre>\r\n<pre>Max host per second:  74 [09/May/2010:10:42:06 +0200] 65.55.104.39<br /></pre>\r\n<pre>Max hosts per second: 15 [12/May/2010:16:19:42 +0200]<br /></pre>\r\n<pre>Max hits per second:  77 [14/May/2010:15:03:15 +0200]<br /></pre>\r\n<p><br />The First/Last timestamps are the first and last entries in the logs that were processed. A period of roughly 6 days. Total hits is the number of entries processed, and total requests is the number of non \'robots,txt\' requests, followed by a breakdown of the count for each status code returned.</p>\r\n<p>However, the next 3 are the areas that are most questionable. Max host per second, is the greatest number of hits in a single second by single IP address. The Max hosts per second, is the greatest number of unique IPs submitting a request in a single second. Lastly, Max hits per second is the greatest number of requests seen in any single second.</p>\r\n<p>So 15 unique IP address hitting the site in a single second, with a maximum rate of 77 requests a second. Does that strike you as reasonable?</p>\r\n<p>In my response to Microsoft I have pointed out that when a bot receives a 403 for every request (for the last 4 months), the bot should be intelligent enough to back off the requests and default to the robots.txt. As it turned out the Apache config was also returning a 403 for the blocked IPs (which has since been fixed), though I maintain that if a bot receives a 403 for a request for robots.txt, it should equate to being disallowed to search and index the site.</p>\r\n<p>However, the attack on Wednesday was from a fresh set of IPs that weren\'t blocked, and were able to read the robots.txt, which explicitly disallows msnbot. All these new IPs completely disregarded robots.txt and searched and indexed the site anyway. I had I not been on the machine at the time, they would have knocked the machine offline.</p>\r\n<p>Another further point I made, was that CPAN Testers is a non-commercial, non-High Availability site, funded by the Perl community and administered by volunteers. Sending 77 requests a second is exactly the same as a denial of service attack for us. We don\'t have funds and resources to managed a fleet of web and database servers with a load balancer calmly managing requests for us. Treating us (or any other non-commercial site) like a major news site is just plain irresponsible.</p>\r\n<p>One link that was sent to me, highlighted that this aggressive behaviour has, at least in one case, cost a site owner money in excessive bandwidth charges. If Microsoft do not put some reasonable controls on their bots then it is only a matter of time before someone sues or contacts the FBI for computer use.</p>\r\n<p>I have provided the logs to Microsoft, so we\'ll see what their response is. As of Saturday, they obviously changed something, as all hits to the www.cpantesters.org domain all switched to just robots.txt requests, seeming to honour the request not to index the site. However, I was still seeing 4 requests a second for a single IP, so it seems they have still some work to do.</p>',NULL);

It\'s good to remind people (even subconciously) just how big CPAN is. In <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/leo_lapworth/2010/05/20000-distributions-on-cpan.html\">his post</a> Leo also wondered what the 20,000th distribution was.

In fact it proved so straightforward I promised to include it in the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Statistics website</a>.</p>\r\n<p>I\'m pleased to say I finally found some time to do just that, and have revamped the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/statscpan.html\">CPAN Statistics page</a> to include the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/statscpan.html#milestones\">CPAN Milestones</a>.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (86,80,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Further beta testng has been ongoing over the last week and all seems to be working well. The metabase search problem, although not resolved completely, now has a mechanism in place to avoid blockages. The feed started up again last week and after 3 days had caught up with a month\'s worth of reports submitted to the metabase. Although this is still in the beta phase, it does give us more confidence that the eco-system can cope with the submission levels we have been seeing in the last year, and has the capacity to cope with much more. Further tests are being carried out, but the days of CT1.0 are definitely numbered now.</p>\r\n<p>Another big news item for CPAN Testers last month, was once again <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/76\">Microsoft\'s aggressive behaviour towards us</a>. A number of commenters on various news threads have the view that the company are unlikely to have specifically targeted us. However, it should be noted that the project lead contacted me this time around, and stated that the logs and suggestions I sent back in Januray, on their request, had been used to modify the bot to be less aggressive towards sites like ours. So we weren\'t exactly unknown to them. This time around, I\'ve again sent logs and suggestions, but have so far not received a word of response. A pity really, as a thank you at the very least for the data, might have helped with damage limitation.</p>\r\n<p>One thing that I have discovered in all this, is that within Apache configuration files order is significant. Previously, blocking the Microsoft IPs was also blocking the robots.txt file, which I have since fixed. I recently spoke with <strong>Alex Chudnovsky</strong>, Managing Director of <a href=\"http://www.majestic12.co.uk\">Majestic 12</a> (their bot, like many others, crawl the site respecting our bandwidth), regarding this incident, and he explained that the <a href=\"http://www.robotstxt.org/norobots-rfc.txt\">specification for handling robots.txt</a>, states that robots should treat a 403 response for the robots.txt file itself, as if the file contained a rule to disallow the bot at the root level. In fact quoting the specification directly:</p>\r\n<p><em>&quot;Specific behaviors for other server responses are not required by this specification, though the following behaviours are recommended:<br /></em></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>On server response indicating access restrictions (HTTP Status Code 401 or 403) a robot should regard access to the site completely restricted.&quot;</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>As the msnbot had been getting that for 4 months, there really is no excuse. As it is, the msnbot is still requesting robots.txt <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/77\">several hundred times a day</a>, which is still overkill and far too aggressive. Until I see much less aggression, they will not be unblocked.</p>\r\n<p>Two further updates to the Statistics website were unveiled last month, the first included some CPAN Milestones for the submissions to CPAN on the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/statscpan.html\">Statistics of CPAN</a> page. <strong>Brian Cassidy</strong> caught me on IRC and was the first to ask who was the first, and although I suspected the answer, I was pleased that <strong>Andreas</strong> was able to give a nice insight into how CPAN started. It is quite something to think that in the last 15 years, 35 distributions have now grown into over 20,000 distributions, many being used daily around the world.</p>\r\n<p>The second update relates to those authors who have email addresses that are now out of date, possibly through moving to new jobs or new personal domains. While the Daily Summaries can easily be switched off to avoid sending emails that can bounce back, it is not so easy for users who want to get in touch with an author. It was for the latter reason that the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/missing.html\">Missing In Action</a> page has been added. There are only a small number of bouncing addresses, but hopefully this will alert and encourage authors to keep their PAUSE accounts up to date.</p>\r\n<p>I\'m not recording new testers and mappings currently, as the mechanism to do this is changing, and will feed into the new Administration site that now needs to use the Metabase as well as the older mechanism. Originally this site was going to be launched in January, but was put on hold as the CT2.0 work became more urgent. Work will begin again on that very soon.</p>\r\n<p>So that\'s all the news this month. Hopefully we should have more definite news regarding the launch of CT2.0 this time next month.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (89,83,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>After 6 months of development work, following 2 years worth of design and preparation, CPAN Testers 2.0 is finally live.</p>\r\n<p>With the rapid growth in CPAN Testers environments and testers over the past few years, the previous method of posting reports to a mailing list had reached a point where the scalability was no longer viable. This was recognised several years ago and discussions for a new system had already begun, with the view that reports should be submitted via HTTP.</p>\r\n<p>At the Oslo QA Hackathon in 2008, David Golden and Ricardo Signes devised the Metabase, with the design work continuing at the Birmingham QA Hackathon in 2009, where David and Ricardo were able to bring others into the thought process to work through potential issues and begin initial coding. A number of releases to CPAN and Github followed, with more people taking an interest in the project.</p>\r\n<p>The Metabase itself is a database framework and web API to store and search opinions from anyone about anything. In the terminology of Metabase, Users store Facts about Resources.&nbsp; In the Metabase world, each CPAN tester is a User. The Resource is a CPAN distribution. The Fact is the test report. Today that&quot;s just the text of the email message, but in the future it will be structured data.&nbsp; The Metabase specifies data storage capabilities, but the actual database storage is pluggable, from flat files to relational databases to cloud services, which gives CPAN Testers more flexibility to evolve or scale over time.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile the CPAN Testers community was also attracting more and more interest from people wanting to be testers themselves. As a consequence the volume of reports submitted increased each month, to the point that the perl.org mail server was struggling to deal with all the mailing lists it hosted. The cpan-testers mailing list was submitting more posts in one day than any other list submitted in a month (in a year in some cases). Robert and Ask, very reasonably, asked if the testers could throttle their submissions down to 5k report posts a day, and set a deadline of 1st March 2010 to switch off the mailing list.</p>\r\n<p>David Golden quickly took on the task to envisage a project plan, and work began in earnest in December 2009. With less than 3 months to the cut-off date, there was a lot of work to do. David concentrated on the Metabase, with Barbie working on ensuring that the current cpanstats database and related websites could move to the Metabase style of reports. Despite a lot of hard work from a lot of people, we unfortunately missed the 1st March deadline. Having throttled report submissions to a more manageable level, and although not complete, the target for HTTP submissions was in sight, Robert and Ask were very understanding and agreed to keep us going a little while longer.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout March and April a small group of beta testers were asked to fire their submissions at the new system. It ironed out many wrinkles and resulted in a better understanding of what we wanted to achieve. The first attempts at retrieving the reports from the Metabase into the cpanstats database began in April, and again highlighted further wrinkles that needed to be addressed. After a month of hard testing and refinement, we finally had working code that went from report submission by a tester, storage into the Metabase, retrieval into the cpanstats database and finally presentation on the CPAN Testers family of websites.</p>\r\n<p>During June the process was silently switched from testing to live, allowing reports to be fed through into the live websites. Due to the ease with which the new style reporting fit into the existing system, the switch largely went unnoticed by the CPAN testers community as well as the Perl community. A considerable success.</p>\r\n<p>The CPAN Testers eco-system is now considerably larger than those early days of simply submitting handwritten reports by email to a mailing list, and the work to get here has featured a cast of thousands.

Using the new web service, existing testers will be able to register and claim addresses which they have previously used to submit reports, and associate them with your &quot;profile&quot;, so that you can continue to be identified in the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/testers.html\">CPAN Testers Leaderboard</a>. The web service will be deployed very shortly, so please be patient, while we get the top testers setup first.</p>\r\n<p>Once the bulk of testers are using the HTTP submission process, the next step will be to contact the less frequent testers. This will mostly be a case of tailing the SMTP submissions and contacting testers individually where possible. The SMTP service will be shut down on or around 31st August, so there should be plenty of time for testers to migrate their current smoker clients to the new system. After this date any report submitted via SMTP will not be processed.</p>\r\n<p>Over the next few months the smoker client tools will be upgraded to use the HTTP submission process by default rather than the SMTP process, thus allowing new testers to automatically be setup to use the new system. In addition, the intention is to provide a mechanism to use the registration web service via an automated API, which will mean that Strawberry Perl installations can automatically be setup to run a CPAN Testers client, and be pre-registered without the user having to do this themselves. The downside to this is that the profile will not be tied to a user that we can necessarily contact, however there are already several submissions each month that use fictious email addresses. The difference with the new registration process, is that at a later date the tester can more actively use their profile file to claim a real email address. Over time we hope this will then become a much more reliable service.</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned in the press release, CT2.0 offers a few advantages for us, one of which is that it doesn\'t truncate reports. Although, we will be monitoring the reports submitted to ensure that none are unnecessarily large. It does mean that we should be able to parse all the necessary metadata from the report, reducing the number of submissions with conflicting or missing data. As we begin to provide more structured data within the report submission, validation of reports will become much more reliable, and include many more detailed aspects of the testing environment.</p>\r\n<p>One aspect of the testing environments, that often causes confusion, is the operating system used. Currently our understanding of the OS used is mostly drawn from the \'Perl -V\' configuration settings, which may not always be correct. In addition, for some OSes the information provided doesn\'t give a clear enough picture. For example, if the OS is Linux, knowing whether it\'s RedHat, Debian or SUSE based may have significant benefits to fixing problems, likewise differentiating between Tiger, Leopard and Snow Leopard for Mac OSX. As such, a <a href=\"http://birmingham.pm.org\">Birmingham.pm</a> initiated project aims to provide this information as part of the structured data of a report. As a first step the creation of <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-Platform-Info\">Devel-Platform-Info</a> is <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/barbie/2010/06/devel-platform-info.html\">underway</a>, and will provide the metadata required in a consistent format, regardless of platform. This will eventually be then included in the CT2.0 style of reporting, simply as an additional Fact.</p>\r\n<p>We\'ve again had some run-ins with a certain search engine last month, and despite various erroreous claims, we were able to provide logs that disproved them all. The search engine has now finally disabled the aggressive crawling of the CPAN Testers site ... having only taken 6 months of asking! They have asked to be allowed to crawl the website again, having claimed to have fixed the problems, but until I have some free time to properly monitor their bots, they will have to wait.</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned in the press release on Monday, there are two forthcoming conferences which will feature talks concerning CPAN Testers. David Golden will be presenting <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/13759\">&quot;Free QA! What FOSS can Learn from CPAN Testers&quot;</a> at OSCON and Barbie will be presenting <a href=\"http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2010/talk/2891\">&quot;CPAN Testers 2.0 : I love it when a plan comes together&quot;</a> at YAPC::Europe.</p>\r\n<p>After several long months of getting CPAN Testers ready for launch, the next month is likely to see activity centred around minor fixes, howtos and helping people migrating to CPAN Testers 2.0. If you do hit any problems, please post them to the <a href=\"http://lists.perl.org/list/cpan-testers-discuss.html\">cpan-testers-discuss mailing list</a>, where many of the high profile testers and developers reside. After the deadline, we\'ll be concentrating on some of the new systems that have been waiting in the wings, and taking a more detailed look at providing more structure data in the reports.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (92,86,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>So last month saw the big announcement that we have now <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/83\">enabled CPAN Testers 2.0</a>, and we have started to see a shift of testers over to the new HTTP submission system. However, there are still a number who are submitting high volumes that we shall now start pestering to move over. Although the regular testers are fairly easy to help setup their smokers to use the new system, it\'s the infrequent testers that are going to a little trickier to catch.</p>\r\n<p>Currently we have a large number of report submissions that appear to be sent when someone installs a distribution they need. As it\'s fairly easy to add CPAN::Reporter to CPAN.pm repetoire, many have done exactly that. Catching those people, when they perhaps only submit 1 or 2 reports a month is going to be a bit tricky. However, hopefully the press release and these summaries will eventually reach those people, who can then upgrade their smoke clients to the new system. With the plan to switch off the list on 1st September, it\'s also likely that bounceback emails (assuming the smokers have been set up with valid email addresses) might also provide an additional incentive.</p>\r\n<p>This week I\'ve been in Pisa for <a href=\"http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2010\">YAPC::Europe</a>, and have given a talk about <a href=\"http://conferences.yapceurope.org/ye2010/talk/2891\">CPAN Testers 2.0</a>, which seems to have gone well. The talk covered some of the thought processes behind the move, the basic elements of the Metabase and takes a look at the new style of Fact based reports. Finally it offers some guidance of how to get involved CT2.0, either as a new tester or an existing tester. <a href=\"http://birmingham.pm.org/talks/barbie/ct20\">The slides are now available online</a>.</p>\r\n<p>A few weeks ago, David Golden presented thoughts behind CPAN Testers, as <a href=\"http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/13759\">Free QA</a>, at OSCON.

Many thanks to those who responded, and I\'m sorry I can\'t respond to everyone individually to say thank you, but it would take quite a while. If you have received this email, and haven\'t had the time to respond yet, please take a few minutes to do so, as it really does help us provide better analysis. It\'s also never too late to respond either. It will possibly be the last such email I will be send, although there might be a last attempt to clean up old emails later in the year. With the ability for testers to register themselves into the Metabase, this email will ultimately unnecessary. On top of the people who have responded, I took some time last month to do some digging and have managed to map over 50 addresses.</p>\r\n<p>This month we\'re mostly going to concentrate on help testers move to CT2.0, but there are lots of things planned to expand the reports and provide more functionality to the eco-system.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (98,92,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>It\'s the end of an era. After 11 years from the <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/6\">first official CPAN Testers test report submission</a>, the cpan-testers mailing list has <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/91\">finally closed its doors</a>. From now on, anyone sending a test report via SMTP, will receive a bounce-back email. Most have already upgraded and reconfigured their smoker clients to use HTTP/S.

It was a talk I tried to give some background to for our reasons and motivations for the move. However, the bottom line is that we want CPAN Testers to evolve and grow further, with more diagnostics and analysis. With the old method of reporting and submission, that just wasn\'t possible. We have lots of ideas to expand the reporting, but first we need CT2.0 to settle in. We need to make upgrading and installation for anyone, especially our casual testers as easy as possible. There is still some fine tuning happening, but we are moving forward.</p>\r\n<p>While at YAPC::Europe this year in Pisa, the <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/brian_d_foy/2010/08/the-2010-white-camel-awards.html\">White Camel Awards</a> were announced. Despite being a reluctant recipient, I was awarded one for my work here with CPAN Testers. While I might be the glue that keeps us together, it really is all of the CPAN Testers Community that makes it all worthwhile. Though I saw the value and worth of what we do several years ago, and perhaps have had more time and motivation to promote what we do, the award really is a big big thank you to all the testers and developers who have been a part of CPAN Testers for the past 11 years. It has been a pleasure meeting many of you at conferences and workshops over the years, and hopefully I\'ll get to meet many more in the future. I started my involvement in CPAN Testers because of a BOF <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/~lbrocard/\">L&eacute;on Brocard</a> gave at YAPC::Europe 2003 in Paris. In turn over the past few years I\'ve helped to encourage others to become involved. The CPAN Testers Community has continually evolved and become a very respected community based testing team, even outside of the echo-chamber. I look forward to what we can achieve in the next 11 years.</p>\r\n<p>In the final days of the SMTP submissions, I have been back mapping many of the addresses to people. Last month I also sent out the request email, for testers to help identify themselves. I had a great response, to which I thank you all, and managed to update several entries. In addition, several newer testers have followed my request and used their CPAN/PAUSE email, or have identified themselves well enough for me to spot them. In addition I took some time to work though mailing lists, whois entries, HTML source, open source code and all manner of nooks and crannies around the internet to identify many more. In all, over the last 2 months I\'ve mapped 167 addresses to real people, of which 106 are new mappings to testers never previously identified. Many of these are brand new testers.</p>\r\n<p>Because the new system of registering a profile is slightly different, the new mechanism to map testers is now also being fed from the Metabase. As such the new Administration system, that has been waiting in the wings for over a year, needs a few updates to be able to use both the new and old systems together. This shouldn\'t be a huge amount of change, but it does mean that it will be a little while longer before we can launch it.</p>\r\n<p>One final achievement that needs noting from last month is the fact that we passed the <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/89\">8 millionth accepted report submission</a>. 11 years ago, I wonder if those first testers ever thought that we would have amassed so many reports. We were getting through roughly 1 million reports every 5-6 months back last year, but the throttling and switch over have reduced the submissions for the first half of this year. We\'re starting to see the numbers climb again, so I expect this time next year we should have passed the 10 millionth report submission.</p>\r\n<p>Onwards and Upwards....</p>',NULL);

The codebase behind the scenes has also been upgrade for several sites to the latest version of Labyrinth, which is the version that is currently being managed for Open Source release.

In the first instance a new index table has been created to speed up processing of perl versions. This has also had a side effect of highlighting some of the perl version parsing from reports that hasn\'t provided the correct text strings. As such these have been quickly fixed within the cpanstats database. There are further plans to improve performance of both the builder and the statistic code, however the biggest drain remains the archiving of the databases using gzip and bzip. bzip is the worst offender, and often hogs both CPU and disk IO, so I\'m now looking at generating some of the archives remotely.</p>\r\n<p>BinGOs very recently released a new version of <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Reporter-Transport-Socket\">Test::Reporter::Transport::Socket</a>, so if you use <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/metabase-relayd/\">metabase-relayd</a> to push out your reports, please make sure you upgrade to the latest version. David Golden has also released a new version of <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Reporter\">CPAN::Reporter</a>, which raises the report limit from 50KB to 1MB. It\'s unlikely we\'ll reach that limit, but reports should now appear with test results beyond the previous 50K boundary. Finally Andreas K&ouml;nig released a new version of <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Version\">CPAN::Version</a>, which fixed an unusual bug, where perl itself was reporting that \'0+(1&lt;0)\' was \'3.33761e-308\'.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (103,97,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Back in <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/26\">January 2008 we were celebrating</a> the one millionth post submitted to CPAN Testers. Although that article proclaimed it to be the one millionth report, many initial posts to the mailing list also included discussions and announcements of uploads. It wasn\'t until I created the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/interest.html\">Interesting Stats</a> page that we started to see the true picture. However, we only had to wait until March 2008 for the real <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/1092334\">one millionth report</a> to be posted. Now some 2 years and 7 months later we\'ve had the <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/96\">nine millionth report</a> submitted. It took 9 years to produce 1 million reports, but only a further 2&frac12; years to produce another 8 million reports. The rate at which CPAN Testers has been able to get people involved in the project has been phenomenal. We are now submitting over 500,000 reports a month, so I have no doubt we will pass the 10 millionth mark before the end of the year .. probably just before Christmas :)</p>\r\n<p>In the comments to my <a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/cpan_testers/2010/10/9-million-test-reports.html\">nine millionth post on Perl Blogs</a>, John Napiorkowski asked of the comparisons for testing packages in other languages, particularly Python and Ruby. Chris Williams provided some links to the testing setups for those languages, and the sites prove rather interesting. From the perspective of trying to find information about test results CPAN Testers wipes the floor with both, as I found both the <a href=\"http://pycheesecake.org/\">Cheese Cake</a> and <a href=\"http://firebrigade.seattlerb.org/\">Firebrigade</a> sites awkward to follow. For the Cheesecake site it seems they are aiming more for a site like <a href=\"http://cpants.perl.org\">CPANTS</a>, which is probably a good first step to encourage a testing culture. While the Firebrigade site seems to have tried to take on the idea of CPAN Testers, but in trying to also be different they\'ve actually made things hard for themselves. I also refute the Ruby claim of &quot;Firebrigade tests every gem ever made on every platform under the sun&quot;. On the front page it lists that it only has tests on 45 platforms. CPAN Testers would never make such a bold or false claim, but with over 100 platforms, and 74 alone during October 2010, I think Perl\'s sun must be much bigger than Ruby\'s, and CPAN Testers are still only scratching the surface. It will be a long time before any other language can compete with CPAN Testers, and with only 20405 reports in nearly 4 years, the Ruby team have a long way to catch up. CPAN Testers should be immensely proud of the work they have put into the project, whether as a developer, tester or even those with just the odd suggestion to help improve the eco-system. Every contribution has helped to make CPAN Testers worthwhile and valued by the Perl community, as well as respected, imitated and/or envied by other language communities. And we\'re still improving.</p>\r\n<p>Talking of improvements, there have been several performance improvements to the applications which produce the web pages for several sites. The <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Statistics</a> site was suffering from the vast amount of number crunching it performed, and was previously using up as much as 3GB of RAM, and often taking over an hour to produce its results. With a rework to save a snapshot of the data, and restart each time from where we left off, the application now uses less than 1GB RAM and processing takes about 40 minutes. The <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org\">CPAN Testers Reports</a> page builder has also seen some tweaks, and again the pages have seen a dramatic improvement in build times. Some author pages were taking over an hour to build, but now even RJBS and ADAMK only take 5-15 minutes. There is still room for improvement, and better use of on disk storage is planned.</p>\r\n<p>Still the biggest drain on resources is bzip2. It is a memory and CPU hog at the best of times, and with it holding IO on occasions, it often has a significant impact on other applications. As such I am taking time to review how the bzip2 files are produced. Part of that is to review how often they need to be generated. Tellingly the frequency of any 1 IP to grab the two most popular archive files (uploads.db.bz and cpanstats.db.bz2) are just once a day. Currently the gzip archive of cpanstats.db.gz has a similar popularity. As such over the next few days expect the archive creations to happen in the early hours of the morning (CET), gathering up the previous days stats. Initially I was planning to move the archiving to another server, but with the archives not being in high demand, I will now look at running one complete archive process a day and see how that effects the server performance. If the change in timestamp is likely to cause problems, please me know and I\'ll see what I can do to help.</p>\r\n<p>In the next few weeks David Golden and I are planning to chat about the future of CPAN Testers. Now that CT2.0 is live, where do we go from here? There are some obvious improvements we can now start to look at, such as expanding the metadata we record, but we have other plans to make CPAN Testers even more reliable and current. Once we\'ve had a chance to discuss the ideas and point them in the right direction, we\'ll let you know more.</p>\r\n<p>In other news, it is likely that the <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org\">Preferences</a> site\'s SSL certificate will fail very soon. For the past 2 years we\'ve been able to qualify for GoDaddy\'s OpenSource scheme which donates a 1 year certificate for any verified Open Source project. Sadly, despite them considering CPAN Testers an Open Source project for the last 2 years, we have now been rejected for not being an Open Source project! Yes, the response surprised me too, but despite attempts to understand why we no longer qualify, they\'ve now closed the request ticket and have effectively ended the discussion. As such, I\'ll be looking to purchase a new SSL certificate from another vendor shortly, who hopefully have a better support policy.</p>\r\n<p>I was intrigued to see Yanick Champoux\'s recent blog post: <a href=\"http://babyl.dyndns.org/techblog/entry/cpantest-to-rt\">Generating RT bugs out of CPAN Testers\' Reports</a>. Yanick was looking for an effective way submit a test report into his RT queue. Unfortunately I can\'t add a button to the site as suggested, as at the current time the site doesn\'t verify that you are the author of a distribution, and opening it up to all would be a nightmare waiting to happen. I did wonder whether this was something that could be added to the Preferences site, but with potentially hundreds of reports coming in, trying to decide whether they are applicable for RT or not could also turn into a nightmare. As such, if you\'re interested in doing this yourself for your own RT queue, read Yanick\'s post and see how you get on.</p>\r\n<p>Moving away from CPAN Testers and looking at CPAN, we <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/statscpan.html\">passed another milestone last month</a>. On 8th October 2010 ETHER became the 5,000th PAUSE user to upload a distribution to CPAN. Although we currently have 8482 PAUSE users (as of 02/11/2010), it is surprising how many have used their ID for other CPAN related activities. After holding the top spot for some considerable time, Adam Kennedy has now been <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/leadercpan.html\">overtaken by Ricardo Signes</a> for the most current distributions attributed to a single PAUSE user. Some years ago it was considered quite a feat to reach 100 distributions, but with 230 active distributions currently to his name, I\'m not surprised Ricardo created Dist::Zilla to help him manage them all :)</p>\r\n<p>Finally, we have some more mappings, with 40 new address mappings, of which 22 are for new testers. Until next time, happy testing :)</p>',NULL);

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (105,99,3,2,0,NULL,'<p>Secondly the Reports site has had some alterations to it to reduce the hits from robots. With around 15-20 crawlers starting to hit the site at once, processing was occasionally affecting other areas of the build process, as well as the backup processes. As such \'rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;\' has been added as an attribute to links for RSS, YAML and JSON files. This had a dramtic effect, as can been seen in the CPU graph, to the point that the server load dropped to under 2.0 for long periods for the first time since I set up the server! The change essentially means crawlers now only reference just under 10 million pages, rather than over 20 million, and don\'t pull several gigabytes of storage data off the server each day.</p>\r\n<p>Thirdly the bzip2 process to archive the backup databases now only happens once a day. With the reduction in server hits, this now takes far less time to process. and no longer has a prolonged effect on the build process. Previously it could take over 2 hours to compress the archive 6 times a day, and now takes about 25 minutes once a day.</p>\r\n<p>In addition there have been some minor tweaks to the build process, but the major changes are still waiting in the wings, as the current data stores need to fully update to allow me to implement them.</p>\r\n<p>Every so often we get asked why a particular report hasn\'t appeared on the Reports site. Depending on the sync process it can be anything between a few minutes and an hour. However, as most watch for reports via the Distro or Author pages, previously it could take up to 5 days to appear. Currently that\'s now down to less than a day. However that still isn\'t quite quick enough, which is why some further improvements will hopefully be implemented over the next week.</p>\r\n<p>Expect some more updates soon on the next set of changes and some of the proposed changes for the future.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (108,100,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Last month saw a number of changes, both major and minor, to the workings of CPAN Testers behind the scenes. As mentioned in the <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/99\">last post</a>, some of these have had a striking effect on the ability to process more reports at a time. Last weekend actually saw us less than 24 hours behind a report being posted and appearing on the site. However, there is a caveat to that which I will come to in a moment. Having done so well to close the gap between reports being submitted and appearing, last weekend I took the opportunity to perform a major reindexing, which prepares the data storage for the next round of changes. Hence the spike you might have seen on the <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org/home/status\">status page</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The biggest change at the moment is that the RSS feeds are now generated dynamically. This has reduced the amount of disk access, as less files are being written to disk for any particular request. Instead the data is now written to the JSON data store, and reformatted as required. Initially this is just for RSS feeds, however I plan to do the same for the YAML feeds too, which will be part of a further post soon. All this does mean there is slightly less for the builder to do, and has been a part of what has helped us to catch up.</p>\r\n<p>As I mentioned, there is a caveat to the improvements. Due to the way the Metabase performs searching, there are some descrepencies between the reports we have stored in the Metabase and what the cpanstats database has. We are addressing the issue and there will be some improvements behind the scenes, however initially we have identified several thousand missing reports. Over the next week these will be injected into the cpanstats database, so we have a more complete picture. If you have spotted missing reports, and they haven\'t appeared by next week, please let me know.</p>\r\n<p>The Metabase search issue is down to problems with SimpleDB not returning the search results correctly. As a consequence David Golden has been investigating the NoSQL databases, to see how we can improve this. There are several options available, and David is currently evaluating the pros and cons of a few to see which offers the most benefits to us, and can provide us with the best migration path and data replication methods to make any transition transparent to the testers and users.</p>\r\n<p>Saywer X this month picked up on a benefit of CPAN Testers in his &quot;<a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/2010/11/blessed-are-the-cpan-testers.html\">Blessed are the CPAN Testers</a>&quot; post. Although this case involved a little more investigation to understand the problem, the fact that CPAN Testers cover such a variety of platforms does mean that we do have a better chance of exposing potential cross-platform issues.</p>\r\n<p>After several weeks of uncertainty, it seems that GoDaddy has decided that we are still an Open Source project, and have granted us another SSL Certificate for a year. As such the <a href=\"https://prefs.cpantesters.org\">Preferences</a> site will shortly be restarted with a new certificate.</p>\r\n<p>That completes the round-up for this month, though there are a few more posts I hope to get out over the coming weeks, so keep an eye out for further updates.

INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (111,103,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>Just about anyone can help out with CPAN Testers. You can be a heavy-weight tester submitting <a href=\"http://stats.cpantesters.org/mtesters.html\">thousands of reports</a> a month, or a casual tester submitting reports for the distributions you install. You can also help promote CPAN Testers on your blog, or join the group on <a href=\"http://lists.cpan.org/showlist.cgi?name=cpan-testers-discuss\">cpan-testers-discuss</a> mailing list (or associated channel on IRC) and help answer questions testers and authors may have.</p>\r\n<p>However, there is a further way you can help, which is a great way for new testers to get an idea for what and how they can contribute, as well as getting to know the whole CPAN Testers eco-system, and that is by updating the <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/\">CPAN Testers Wiki</a>.</p>\r\n<p>In November, the <a href=\"http://birmingham.pm.org/\">Birmingham Perl Mongers</a> technical meeting featured a CPAN Testers hackathon. Since the release of CT2.0 and the Metabase, many of the instructions for getting started with CPAN Testers where either no longer relavent or out of date. JJ\'s idea was to take one aspect of the wiki and update it with the correct information. Seeing as the majority of people who are likely to use the wiki are new testers, we figured that concentrating on a getting started page would be of the most benefit. We decided to show how to set up CPAN-Reporter, for the casual tester wishing to submit reports for distributions as they installed them.</p>\r\n<p>We started from a clean setup, on multiple platforms/virtual machines to see whether anything would be different. As it turned out, the installation of distributions and the configuration of CPAN Testers was exactly the same. We went through the steps to claim a Metabase key, which in the longer term will hopefully be slightly more automated, and updated the appropriate configuration files to ensure we could submit reports via the new CT2.0 API. It was an interesting hackathon, as we tried to look at the set up as if we hadn\'t had any experience of CPAN Testers. It highlighted a few areas that we can hopefully improve on, but mostly guided us to explain the steps better.</p>\r\n<p>The final result is the beginnings of the <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/TestDuringInstall\">Test During Install</a> page. We hope to have another hacking session looking at setting up CPANPLUS/CPANPLUS-YACSmoke in exactly the same way in the coming months.</p>\r\n<p>So if you\'d also like to contribute, have a look at whether you can update the installation and configuration instructions for other set ups, such as with more sophisticated smokers. It would be very much appreciated.</p>',NULL);
INSERT INTO `paragraphs` VALUES (112,104,1,2,0,NULL,'<p>December turned out to be a very interesting month. After a lot of tweaks, I updated several parts of the ecosystem from the Generator, which takes the metabase reports and parses them for the cpanstats database, through to the Builder, which builds the files used by the Reports website, to the Uploads mechanism, which monitors the changes in CPAN and new uploads to PAUSE. It has all helped to streamline the process a little, which means the processing from a report submission to appearing on the CPAN Testers Reports website is getting quicker.</p>\r\n<p>Back in November I reported that <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/99\">the Builder had caught up</a> so that pages were getting built in less than 24 hours. This was shortlived, as the changes made to the ecosystem meant a total rebuild of all pages was required. In addition since the launch of CT2.0, there had been a number of reports that hadn\'t been passed between the Metabase server and the CPAN Testers server. As a consequence, David Golden provided me with a list of the missing reports, and I set about parsing over 70,000 reports. During the first few weeks of December, this meant the build once again fell back to updating within 5 days. However, with all the improvements it has quickly caught up again and is now roughly 36 hours behind. There are still a few improvements left to include, so hopefully we\'ll start seeing most (if not all) reports appearing on the Reports site in less than 24 hours.</p>\r\n<p>A noticeable improvement has been to reduce the default creation of RSS files. The next improvement is to reduce the default creation of YAML files. The RSS and YAML are essentially support files and can be dynamically created on request from the JSON file that is created with all the cpanstats report information regarding a distribution or author. If you have an application that uses the current YAML files, please look at whether it can switch to using the JSON files instead. This will reduce the burden on the server and allow us to process reports even quicker.</p>\r\n<p>Just before Christmas we also passed the <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/102\">10 million reports</a> mark, that\'s 10 million reports submitted in a little over 10 years. With the launch of CT2.0, CPAN Testers is a testing service to be truly reckoned with. While other languages may have sought to emulate our success, I have yet to see any posts of others coming anywhere close to CPAN Testers.</p>\r\n<p>Having said that, it seems we aren\'t that great at self-promotion either. While these summaries hopefully add to the search caches, it is surprising how many have either forget the efforts of CPAN Testers over the past year, or where unaware of them in the first place. Though very grateful thanks go to <a href=\"http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2010/12/the-best-of-perl-2010.html\">chromatic</a> and <a href=\"http://martian.org/karen/2011/01/01/perl-2010/\">Karen</a> for including us in their mentions of Perl accomplishments in 2010. If you are planning a look at Perl accomplishments, please don\'t forget to mention CPAN Testers. Behind most the Perl projects you are likely to mention, CPAN Testers have probably helped to iron out quirks and bugs on their way towards the success stories they have become.</p>\r\n<p>The CT2.0 project was perhaps the biggest project overhaul I\'ve ever been involved with, and the fact that we managed to get it done in 6 months, with a small team of developers is phenonmenal. CPAN Testers continues to evolve and I think we are well placed to grow ever more exponentially for the next 10 years. Thank you to everyone who has been involved in the CT2.0, all the testers (even if you\'ve only submitted 1 report this year) and to everyone who has offered suggestions, feedback and thanks to all the efforts over the past year. Special thanks should also go to Robert, Ask and L&eacute;on who truly set CPAN Testers on the road to being the project it is today, and nutured it for many years before David and I were able to take over.</p>\r\n<p>If you watch the recent upload lists, you may have noticed a release on 1st Jan 2011. Originally this had been planned for some time in 2010, but other tasks took priority. After having several people ask about it, Labyrinth has finally been released, which provides the core engine behind several of the CPAN Testers websites. This now means I will be releasing the code to run the <a href=\"http://www.cpantesters.org/\">Reports</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.cpantesters.org/\">Blog</a>, <a href=\"http://wiki.cpantesters.org/\">Wiki</a> and <a href=\"https://prefs.cpantesters.org/\">Preferences</a> websites in the coming months. This should hopefully make the whole ecosystem more accessible to anyone wishing to submit patches. In addition I hope it also provides the ability for other projects and businesses to develop their own in house testing, reporting and analysis systems.</p>\r\n<p>Looking forward to 2011, there are lots of plans for CPAN Testers, from the testing clients, documentation and server side development through to encouraging more testers on more diverse platforms to get involved. It\'ll also be interesting to see whether anyone can compete with Chris Williams multi-million report submission achievement. Whatever happens, I\'m sure there will be plenty to write about.</p>',NULL);

However, there were further fixes and enhancements planned.</p>\r\n<p>Several updates ensued during January, not just for the Builder, but across several parts of the eco-system, both to speed up processing and to reduce the amount of file and database access. Previously several processes recreated their current view by reading the full result set from the database. As we now have over 10 million reports, this can take more time than is reasonable. With the use of the JSON files to record a snapshot, we can now start from a known point, thus meaning we only need to scan a few thousand records. This method has been utlised in other processes, even with smaller database tables and datasets, and the performance improvements have been significant.</p>\r\n<p>For the past couple of weeks we have now been able to update pages within 36 hours of a report being submitted, and at times we have even been less than an hour behind. Looking at the graphs the Builder is now consistently processing more pages than reports. Even though January is typically a quieter month for us, it still produced 333,157 reports. We shall see whether the increased submissions in the coming months make a difference in build times.</p>\r\n<p>You may already know that the <a href=\"http://2011.qa-hackathon.org\">2011 QA Hackathon</a> is happening in Amsterdam this year, but it warrants promotion.

It\'s interesting to note that many of the new testers are not CPAN Authors, which is great. One of the benefits to CPAN Testers is that you can help to contribute to the project without having to be a hardcore Perl dev, and can contribute as little or as much as you are able. We are fast approaching 11 million test reports and I\'m pleased to see we are continually encouraging new people to get involve and keep the submissions rising. Long may it continue.</p>',NULL);

Thankfully the improvements seem to have done their job. The report submissions in January dropped from previous months, which is normal going on past experience, and sure enough the submissions increased again last month. Despite this the builder has managed to stay on top of the page requests. Some fine tuning has taken place and currently the builder stays at most about 2-3 days behind, but is average in only 1-2 days behind.
